2024-05-03 16:20:00,25 Most Profitable Companies in the US,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 most profitable companies in the US. If you want to skip our overview of the US economy and the current business climate, you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Companies in the US. With the second quarter of 2024 with us, Wall Street is focused on determining whether companies that are investing in AI are actually bringing in money or whether they are investing costly capital to set themselves up for future growth. Firms that belong to the former sector, i.e. those that are making money from AI, have been rewarded as has been the case with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Just like NVIDIA is Wall Street's favorite AI stock when it comes to semiconductors needed to power up large data processing software, Microsoft is the king of the jungle when it comes to AI software. In the latter segment, the best example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares have dropped after the latest earnings report revealed that 2024 will require an additional $40 billion in capital to fund AI growth.This sharp eye on AI comes when investors are grappling with an economy that might be starting to slow down just as the Federal Reserve finds it difficult to tamp down on inflation. While the AI gold rush of 2023 put inflation and other macroeconomic indicators on the backdrop, after the inflation data for March 2024, they are back in the spotlight. This environment, which has left investors eager to flee away from stocks once again comes as profitability becomes key, particularly as profits are important to enable firms to position themselves for growth (such as is the case with AI stocks) or keep investors happy by paying out dividends.US companies are also some of the biggest in the world when it comes to profits. America's corporate sector, particularly the technology industry, is the most developed in the world. Firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are able to compete with the world's largest state owned enterprises when it comes to revenue. In fact, Apple is the first company in the world that has proven that technology and personal computing is a more lucrative industry than oil - a commodity that is responsible for powering daily lives. To understand how, consider that Apple's trailing twelve month revenue as of December 2023 sits at a whopping $385 billion.Now, compare this with the net sales of the Saudi state owned oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), which has raked in SAR2 trillion during the same time period. Using an exchange rate of 3.75 SAR to a dollar leads to approximately $530 billion in revenue for the Saudi oil giant. While naturally, Aramco's revenue is higher since it does not have any comparable competitors on a global level, the fact that a consumer technology firm that is dependent not only on the need to stay abreast with innovation but also with what its rivals are doing is able to earn more than half of the revenue is something in itself to say the least.As a whole, Insider Monkey also looked at the 30 Largest Companies in the World by Revenue. This shows that US companies reign supreme even though Aramco enjoys free access to the vast global crude oil market. The US retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) tops this list courtesy of its $648 billion in sales, showing that a well run privately owned company has the full potential to take on massive state owned giants.But what about profits? After all, even if a firm makes hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, its investors get nothing if money does not flow through the income statement and into retained earnings. Today, we'll look at some of the most profitable companies in America, with a couple of top picks being Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Photo by Christian Dubovan on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the most profitable companies in the US, we ranked all publicly listed US firms by their trailing twelve month net income available on Yahoo Finance and picked out those with the highest profit.Trailing Twelve Month Net Income: $10.9 billion ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is an American oil and gas company headquartered in Houston, Texas.

2024-05-03 16:11:00,Top 25 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now,"In this piece, we will take a look at the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500 by index weight right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the flagship stock index and some recent news for its biggest constituents then you can skip ahead to Top 10 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now.The S&P 500 plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, politics, and the finance industry. This is because it is one of the most widely followed barometer of the economy, with investors and finance professionals using its data to inform their daily decision making. For politicians, a rising index means that they can boast to voters for having managed the economy well. For finance professionals, they can rest easy knowing that the pricey bets that they might have made on the stock market are doing well.When compared to other indexes, the S&P 500, managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), is particularly important because of the stringent conditions that a firm must meet to be included in it. For starters, only sizeable large cap stocks, or those with a market capitalization greater than $18 billion can be included in the index. These large cap stocks must also be highly liquid, generate most of their revenue in America, and of course, be profitable. These criteria remove most firms that might not do well financially, and as a result, the S&P is also recommended as a great passive investment.Shifting to its performance, 2024 has been a fireworks filled year for the S&P 500. The index is up by 6.9% year to date, after it also crossed the illustrious 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history. In fact, year to March 28, 2024 the index had marked 11% in gains, but it ended up losing these after the inflation data for the month led to investors significantly revising their Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations for 2024.In April, while the index did end up revaluing itself in the wake of shifting rate cut paradigms, the first quarter of 2024 earnings season marked by Wall Street's enduring focus on artificial intelligence seems to have injected some life into it. The season, at least as far as artificial intelligence and technology stocks are concerned, started by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) sharing its latest financial performance on April 24th. Meta's results led to tens of billions of dollars in market value being wiped out as investors didn't take too well to $40 billion in AI spending for 2024 at a time when expenses were growing. These were followed by results from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which were more favorably received. If anything, the latest earnings reports have at least stopped the S&P 500 from bleeding further losses, and right now, Wall Street is focused on the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of April.While this meeting is not expected to yield a rate cut, the focus, as always, is on comments made by the Fed after its meetings. These comments help set the tone for future monetary policy actions, and traders will also focus on earnings from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to see whether there's any juice left for more growth. Google parent Alphabet's earnings came with a nice surprise for investors in the form of a dividend, and Wall Street is now focused on whether Amazon will follow suit.However, while the economic picture on the surface might point to fewer Fed interest rate cuts, the S&P 500 might surprise by posting gains if the central bank overshoots market expectations or considers economic weakness more strongly than expected. Just what might force the Fed to swing the other way despite hot inflation and labor costs? Olivia Micklem of Artemis Investment has some insights:Obviously we can see with the data that's been coming through in recent weeks that inflation continues to run hotter than we would have liked to see at this point in the year. That being said, alongside that we are starting to see pockets of weakness in the economy whether that's parts of the consumer economy and other parts of the industrial complex. We got some softer number out of some of the trucking companies last week, for example. So there are indications that some parts of the economy are slowing down. I think we still remain you know cautiously optimistic that there could be an opportunity as we move through the year for the Fed to stay on track with some of their plans to start bringing rates down.So, with the S&P 500's future remaining as dynamic as ever, we decided to look at which stocks have been assigned the highest weights by its managers. A few notable ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Our MethodologyFor our list of the top S&P 500 stocks by weight, we used the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as a proxy and verified the data by the S&P's limited publicly available information about the S&P 500's top ten stocks.ETF Weight: 0.6%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the biggest banks in America.

2024-05-03 15:14:00,Why analysts are expecting a rough earnings report from Apple tonight,"Even though Apple has silenced critics and beaten existential crises before, some fans of its minimalist products and investors in its maximalist stock are nervous.Apple is set to report its second quarter earnings on Thursday after the bell. The numbers come at a time the company continues to grapple with growth challenges due in part to a sales slowdown in China and a customer base seemingly less interested in upgrading to its latest iPhone lineup.Analysts are expecting low sales figures for the quarter ending March 31 – despite the company beating expectations in the last four quarters.This will be its first earnings report since the launch of its biggest new product in years, its $3,499 mixed reality Vision Pro headset. Apple spent about $100 billion in research and development on the device, according to a recent analysis.The headset launched just as the extended reality (XR) market — a category that includes augmented, virtual and mixed reality — has plateaued with little mainstream consumer adoption. The Vision Pro had limited apps out of the gate but its experience is unmatched when it comes to watching immersive videos and interacting with the world around you, with buy-ins already from Hollywood studios and game developers.Still, it’s an expensive computer you wear on your face.Most recently, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted an updated forecast for the headset, stating production was being cut by several hundred thousand units.Although it’s unlikely Apple will reveal a specific number of headsets sold in the latest quarter, it may give a general update about how it’s performing.In particular, the company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have hurt Apple over the past several months. Market research firm IDC said Apple’s smartphone shipments tumbled a stunning 10% globally in the first quarter of this year.Chinese manufacturers, including Huawei and Xiaomi, have also made notable gains as consumers who once would have considered Apple are now turning to national brands in China.“It’s a steep drop for Apple, but if you think of where we have been in the past four years, Apple has probably been the most resilient brand, overcoming supply chain issues and macro challenges, more than other brands,” said Nabila Popal, research director at IDC, told CNN at the time.Samsung also had been the top smartphone manufacturer for the past 12 years. Although Apple took the crown last year, its time on top lasted only one quarter. Samsung has since reclaimed its position, IDC reported.The company’s stock price has slumped more than 8% in 2024 to less than $170 a share after reaching nearly $200 per share at different points in the past year. The company has overcome hurdles and threats many times before to reach a market capitalization of $2.6 trillion, making it one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world.According to David McQueen, research director at tech intelligence firm ABI Research, the company could spark sales growth soon.“It [may] engender a ‘super cycle’ as it rolls out generative AI features in its upcoming products, despite being “a little late to the generative AI party,” he told CNN.Apple has not yet sent a strong message about artificial intelligence at a time when many tech companies are doubling down on related strategies and features. But rumors indicate the company will introduce new AI-powered tools at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June.The company is also reportedly in talks with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to power an iPhone chatbot.Apple is holding a press event next week where it’s largely expected to introduce updates to its iPad lineup and related accessories. It’s unclear if its next-generation iPadOS software, also set to be unveiled in June, will include AI-powered tools, too.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-set-report-earnings-amid-110029853.html,AAPL,0.08900000000000001,0.04,0.871,0.9809,Positive,171.99000549316406,184.1300048828125,7.058549335374581,1
2024-05-03 15:04:00,Apple to extend new core technology fee to iPadOS apps,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple will extend a newly introduced core technology fee to iPadOS apps downloaded on its App Store after the operating system for iPads was added to a list of key services subject to EU tech rules, the iPhone maker said on Thursday.Apple in March announced a core technology fee (CTF) of 50 euro cents per user account per year for major app developers even if they do not use any of its payment services or its App Store, with the first 1 million user accounts exempted from the fee.The CTF is part of a set of new charges linked to changes to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which requires Apple to open up its closed ecosystem by allowing apps developers to distribute their iPhone apps directly to consumers instead of through its App Store, among other obligations.""This week, the European Commission designated iPadOS a gatekeeper platform under the Digital Markets Act. Apple will bring our recent iOS changes for apps in the European Union to iPadOS later this fall, as required,"" the company said in a blogpost.""The CTF will also apply to iPadOS apps downloaded through the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative marketplaces,"" it said.The company also said small developers with less than 10 million euros ($10.7 million) in global annual business revenue will either pay no CTF or a capped CTF during a three-year period.Developers with no revenues such as students, hobbyists, and developers who create a free app without monetization will not be charged the CTF.Currently only developers whose apps do not surpass one million first annual installs per year, non-profit organizations, government entities and educational institutions approved for a fee waiver are exempted from the CTF.($1 = 0.9360 euros)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Susan Fenton)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-extend-core-technology-fee-150400552.html,AAPL,0.037000000000000005,0.026000000000000002,0.937,0.5562,Positive,171.5500030517578,184.75,7.694547778154022,1
2024-05-03 15:00:00,Apple adds more carve-outs to its EU core tech fee after criticism from devs,"Apple is tweaking how it applies a new fee that can apply to iOS developers in the European Union as it continues to configure its approach to the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA): Developers of free apps will be able to avoid the fee entirely under changes it announced Thursday, which apply from today, while other developers earning under a certain revenue threshold will get longer before they have to pay Apple the fee.The so-called ""core technology fee"" remains opt in for iOS developers in the region, as Apple continues to offer its standard business terms, but those wanting to take up new entitlements the DMA has required Apple to offer -- such as allowing sideloading of apps, third party app stores, and support for alternative payment tech than Apple's own -- must agree to the set of business terms that include the CTF (as Apple calls it). The fee remains under scrutiny in the region where the Commission, which enforces the DMA on Apple and other gatekeepers -- and opened its first investigations including on Apple in March -- is actively exploring whether the mechanism is enabling the iPhone maker to avoid its obligations to open up the App Store to competition, such as from third party app stores. But so far the EU hasn't prevented Apple from charging a fee.Apple said it's making changes to the CTF in response to feedback from thousands of developers who have expressed concerned the fee risks penalizing those who offer free non-commercial apps or small developers who end up with a surprise hit on their hands. An app that goes viral and crosses the 1 million first annual installs threshold Apple had already set before the fee kicks in could land up owing the tech giant a lot of money, since the fee costs €0.50 for each first annual install per year after the 1M threshold.In information provided for developers, Apple said the no-fee-for-free-apps tweak is intended to give ""students, hobbyists, and other non-commercial developers an opportunity to create a popular app without paying the CTF"". Developers will need to certify their non-commercial status annually to Apple to keep qualifying for the fee exemption. (NB: Government bodies and accredited educational institutions were already exempted from paying the CTF, provided they meet Apple's criteria.)Apple said the second change it's announced aims to provide small developers that score a hit app more time to scale their business. Devs earning less than €10 million in global annual business revenue will get a 3-year ""free on-ramp to the CTF"", as its developer materials put it.""Within this 3-year period, if a small developer that hasn't previously exceeded one million first annual installs crosses the threshold for the first time, they won't pay the CTF, even if they continue to exceed one million first annual installs during that time,"" Apple wrote.

2024-05-03 14:32:00,US STOCKS-Wall Street rises as Fed rate-hike concerns alleviate,"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window)*Qualcomm gains on upbeat Q3 forecast*DoorDash slides after dour Q2 core profit forecast*Indexes up: Dow 0.18%, S&P 0.11%, Nasdaq 0.33%(Updated at 10:01 a.m. ET/1401 GMT)By Shristi Achar A and Shashwat ChauhanMay 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes advanced on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and allayed worries around potential rate hikes, with focus moving to a crucial job report later in the week.While Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that stubbornly high inflation would see a long-expected U.S. rate cut pushed back, he refused to entertain talk that rates might actually need to go up again.Money markets see a 58% chance of the first rate cut of at least 25 basis points (bps) being delivered in September, but have priced in a greater 68.4% chance of a cut in November, according to CME FedWatch tool.""The outcome of the (Fed) statement, plus the press conference was for slightly more rate cuts to be priced in, not necessarily sooner, but by the end of the year,"" said Brian Nick, senior investment strategist at the Macro Institute.On Wednesday, U.S. stocks initially rose, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed lower for the day after the Fed decision.Meanwhile, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held steady at a low level last week, pointing to a still fairly tight labor market.A separate reading showed new orders for U.S.-manufactured goods rose 1.6% in March, in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters.Focus now moves to the key nonfarm payrolls data on Friday for a clearer outlook on the labor market and the interest rate path.Of the 310 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings as of Wednesday, 77.4% have surpassed earnings estimates, compared with the historical average of 67%, according to LSEG data.At 10:01 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 69.56 points, or 0.18%, to 37,972.85, the S&P 500 gained 5.60 points, or 0.11%, to 5,023.99, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 51.79 points, or 0.33%, to 15,657.28.Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were trading higher, with information technology and consumer discretionary stocks among top gainers.Apple gained 1.1% ahead of the iPhone maker's quarterly results due after the closing bell.Qualcomm gained nearly 9% after the smartphone chips supplier forecast quarterly sales and adjusted profit above Wall Street expectations.Carvana surged 35.5% as the used-car seller forecast a surprise rise in current-quarter retail sales and core profit.MGM Resorts added 3.3% after the casino operator beat first-quarter Wall Street estimates, driven by strength in its China operations.DoorDash lost 13.3% as the food delivery firm projected second-quarter core profit below estimates.Etsy shed 16.3% after the online marketplace missed Wall Street expectations for first-quarter gross merchandise sales and profit.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.84-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.36-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500 posted ten new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 40 new highs and 42 new lows.

2024-05-03 14:18:00,Apple earnings are more crucial to the stock market than Nvidia,"Updated at 11:05 AM EDTApple shares moved higher in early trading on May 2, but remain one of the year's worst-performing Magnificent 7 tech stocks ahead of its latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell.Apple  (AAPL)  lost its title as the world's most valuable company to Microsoft and its place as the top smartphone seller to Samsung this year. The tech giant has faced stiff demand headwinds, an uninspired upgrade cycle, and a lack of a clear AI strategy.The group may have also ceded its ephemeral status as the market's most important stock to AI-chip maker Nvidia  (NVDA) , which has added nearly $1 trillion to its market value this year as demand for the world's hottest technology has exploded.However, while Nvidia gathers the bulk of its sales from just a handful of companies, including Microsoft  (MSFT) , Meta Platforms  (META) , Alphabet  (GOOG)  and Tesla  (TSLA) , Apple's broader reach into the consumer space, its global services business footprint, and its bellwether status in stock indexes and investment portfolios make it as relevant to Wall Street as it ever was.Apple shares comprise around 5.7% of the S&P 500's index weight, around 7.7% of the Nasdaq and, along with Amazon  (AMZN ) and Microsoft, is the only Mag 7 stock that sits in both major indices as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The stock is also the single-largest holding in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio and carries a market value of $2.65 trillion.Justin Sullivan&sol;Getty ImagesThe iPhone giant hopes to revive that status, and its year-to-date slump, by addressing perhaps the most important component of the current investor zeitgeist at its annual developers' conference later this spring. But its slow-footed embrace of the world's hottest technology has been costly.Samsung, its main smartphone rival, said the AI functions in its high-end Galaxy S24 have been a key sales driver, while its overall unit shipments held steady at 60 million over the first three months of the year despite slumping global demand.Apple CEO Tim Cook has said generative AI technologies remain a ""huge opportunity"" for the group, and in February, he promised investors ""some things that we are incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.""Related: Analyst revamps Apple stock rating ahead of key earnings reportFirst, however, the group has to power through its March quarter earnings report, which is expected to include the biggest slide in iPhone sales in at least three years.Apple is expected to post a 1.3% drop in its bottom line from the year-earlier period to $1.250 a share, with revenue down 5.1% to just over $90 billion.iPhone sales, meanwhile, are forecast to have fallen more than 10.4% to $46 billion amid fading China demand. March quarter sales last year were boosted by the late delivery of post-holiday orders that had been hit by Covid supply-chain snarls.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring, who clipped his Apple price target by $10 to $210 a share on April 22, calls the current market backdrop a ""tricky setup"" for the tech giant before its earnings update and ahead of the June developers' conference.Woodring, who carries a buy rating on the stock, sees Apple topping March-quarter revenue estimates but guiding for overall June-quarter sales in the region of $80 billion compared with the current Wall Street consensus of around $83.5 billion.""That said, with Apple's biggest [Worldwide Developers Conference] ever on June 10, we'd buy post-earnings weakness,"" Woodring said.Related: A brand-new Apple product is facing a grim future amid low salesWedbush analyst Dan Ives, who carries a $250 price target and outperform rating on Apple stock, is also braced for what he sees as a ""brutal March quarter"", but eyes a second-half turnaround helped in part by Apple's AI plans.""The good news is help is on the way as we believe a pent-up demand cycle with an AI-driven iPhone 16 model on the horizon should enable Cook & Co. to return to growth again in China with tailwinds into 2025,"" he said.""We expect to hear more breadcrumbs around the broader AI strategy on the conference call as we believe AI will be a game changer for the Apple story over the coming years,"" he added.One early development could be reports that Apple is in talks with OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed creator of the ChatGPT chatbot, to integrate some of its technologies into the Apple ecosystem.Bloomberg, which reported the talks on April 26, said the aim could be to bring OpenAI features into Apple's upcoming iOS 18 operating system, likely to enhance demand for the autumn iPhone 16 launch.Morgan Stanley's Woodring also sees Apple's China struggles as another key focus for Cook when he speaks to analysts following the March quarter update.Data from Counterpoint Research last month suggested that Apple has also lost its place as the top smartphone seller in China, the world's biggest market, with first-quarter sales falling nearly 20% from a year earlier.China remains one of the most important markets for Apple, accounting for around 20% of its global sales, which were pegged last year at around $386 billion. But, that share has fallen steadily since 2015 and has largely plateaued since the 2020 pandemic.LSEG data suggest Apple's greater China sales likely fell 14.4% from a year earlier to 15.25 billion.Related: Nvidia set to capture billions as big tech boosts AI spendingCook took a five-day visit to China in March, during which he opened the company's newest flagship Apple Store in Shanghai and met with key suppliers and government officials including Commerce Minister Wang Wentao.More AI Stocks:Analyst unveils eye-popping Palantir stock price target after Oracle dealVeteran analyst delivers blunt warning about Nvidia's stockAnalysts revamp Microsoft stock price target amid OpenAI reportsAlliance Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, however, sees Apple's China issues as ""more cyclical than structural."" He argues in a note published on April 29 that the stock has ""derated significantly amid a weak iPhone 15 cycle and fears that Apple’s China business is structurally impaired.""Historically Apple’s China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base,"" Sacconaghi wrote. He lifted his rating on the group to outperform from market perform — effectively to buy from neutral — while keeping his $195 price target in place.""We further believe that replacement-cycle tailwinds and incremental generative-AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle,” he added.Apple shares were last marked 1.3% higher on May 2 and changing hands at $171.53 each, a move that would still leave the stock down more than 7.5% for the year.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-earnings-more-crucial-stock-141858607.html,AAPL,0.094,0.055,0.852,0.9934,Positive,171.4949951171875,183.8052978515625,7.1782285692728305,1
2024-05-03 13:35:00,Apple’s Earnings Come With a Low Bar and Big Buyback Hopes,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is facing something unusual as it gears up to report its second-quarter results after the close: low expectations.Most Read from BloombergUS and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle EastSaudi Arabia Steps Up Arrests Of Those Attacking Israel OnlineBiden Calls Ally Japan ‘Xenophobic’ Along With China, RussiaHuawei Secretly Backs US Research, Awarding Millions in PrizesTurkey Halts All Trade With Israel Over War in GazaIts reputation as a haven that can outperform in all market conditions has been refuted this year, as it sharply lags peers with better growth, a clearer AI narrative, a cheaper price tag — or all of the above. The upshot is, there may be less room for disappointment with a lowered bar, especially with a massive buyback announcement likely.“Expectations aren’t very high this quarter, but if we get a better outlook, coupled with some reasons for excitement over AI, we could see the valuation start to expand quite a bit,” said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “It might be tough to count on that, but Apple is a high-quality defensive stock, with a lot of shareholder returns and cash flow. The shareholder returns are the dominant reason to have a position.”Analysts expect Apple to add another $90 billion to its repurchase program, suggesting it will follow Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. among the big-tech names that have announced huge buybacks this year. Apple has already spent more than $650 billion buying back its own stock since 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The buybacks have been a way for Apple to support earnings. Revenue is expected to fall almost 5% this quarter, which would represent its weakest rate in more than a year, as well as Apple’s fifth quarter of the past six with negative growth. Overall tech revenue is expected to rise 8.6% this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.The growth trends largely reflect the Greater China region, which accounted for nearly 19% of Apple’s 2023 revenue. The company has seen weak China iPhone sales as it loses market share to Huawei Technologies Co.The stock is down 11% this year, compared with a gain of 3.9% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. Relative to the tech-heavy benchmark, Apple’s underperformance in the first quarter of 2024 was its sharpest in more than a decade. The stock rose 1.6% on Thursday.Analysts are largely cautious. The consensus for Apple’s full-year revenue has dropped 2.2% over the past quarter, while the view for its net earnings is down 0.8%. Fewer than 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a ratio well below that of other megacap tech.Still, such headwinds could be priced into shares following the year-to-date drop. Bernstein upgraded the stock earlier this week, calling the China weakness “more cyclical than structural” and urging investors to “buy the fear.” Similarly, Citi sees a bottom in sentiment.Read more: Apple Report to Show How It’s Coping With Slowdown: PreviewThe stock hardly scans as a bargain, though, trading near 25 times estimated earnings. While this is notably below a 2020 peak, it is still above its long-term average, as well as the market overall. Furthermore, other megacaps have multiples that are comparable or even lower despite their stronger growth trends.“It is harder to find an argument to buy Apple compared with the other megacaps,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. “It can’t substantiate growth, it doesn’t have a killer AI strategy, and it isn’t even cheap.”The iPhone maker is among the last of the megacaps to report, and the group’s results have been mostly positive. Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. all gained, while Meta Platforms Inc. fell on a mixed revenue forecast and its spending plans. Nvidia Corp, the chipmaker most tied to AI, reports later this month.Read more: Apple’s OpenAI Talks Intensify as It Seeks to Add AI FeaturesA common theme for megacap upside has been AI-related demand, an area where Apple is relatively absent. However, it is refocusing its Macs on AI, news that spurred the stock’s best day in nearly a year last month, and it has been in talks with both OpenAI and Alphabet about adding some AI features to the iPhone. More details are expected at an event in June.If the results feature any further details on its AI strategy, that could provide additional excitement. Otherwise, an aggressive capital-return strategy could remind investors what they like about Apple amid a backdrop marked by high inflation and uncertainty over Fed policy.“I’m a long-term Apple bull, and while I’m turning pessimistic about it in the near term, I’m trying to err on the side of optimism,” Morgan said. “Headwinds seem pretty priced in and it has a huge cash hoard, so repurchasing shares and increasing its dividend could reinvigorate interest. However, until it finds a way to really reignite growth, I think the stock could be stuck in the mud.”Tech Chart of the DaySK Hynix Inc. revealed that its capacity to make high-bandwidth memory chips is almost fully booked through next year, underscoring the intense demand for semiconductors essential to artificial intelligence development.

2024-05-02 17:21:00,"After Nvidia and Apple, Alibaba Chases Vietnam: New Data Center to Boost Control and Meet Local Laws","Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) plans to construct a data center in Vietnam to meet legal requirements for local data storage and to cater to increasing demand in one of Asia’s fastest-growing economies.Currently, Alibaba rents server space from Vietnamese state-owned telecommunications companies Viettel and VNPT.The arrangement follows Vietnam’s contentious 2022 law mandating that companies store data within the country—a regulation that sparked resistance from major tech firms like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the Nikkei Asia reports.Dang Minh Tam, Alibaba Cloud’s solution architect lead, noted that the company uses colocation services from these state companies to store client data locally. It also maintains backups across its server farms in regions including Taiwan and Singapore.The move is part of Alibaba’s strategy to ensure better security and control over its data and potentially reduce costs and liability issues associated with multi-company data management.Companies including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) have reached out to Vietnam to diversify their supply chain base amid heightening geopolitical tensions between the US and China.Lam Research weighed the supply chain shift to Vietnam, with the Vietnamese government canvassing the former to commit $1 billion to local production efforts.Apple suppliers in Vietnam increased by 40% to 35 in 2023.Meanwhile, Nvidia tapped Vietnamese tech firms for AI development.Alibaba stock lost over 11% in the last 12 months.

2024-05-02 16:58:00,Will Apple Beat on Q2 Earnings Amid iPhone Slump? ETFs in Focus,"All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on May 2. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.Apple shares are down about 7.6% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 3.9%. The trend is expected to reverse, given that the tech giant has a reasonable chance to beat earnings estimates. It saw positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).This has put investors’ focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and sport a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Apple has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Apple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal second quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year decline of 0.7% for earnings and 5.1% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.The stock has a top Growth Score of A. It currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations. Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 60.71% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.Based on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $204.88. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00.On the last earnings call, the tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the ongoing quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that iPhone sales in the March quarter would be similar to last year’s $51.33 billion in revenues. This excludes $5 billion in sales attributed to outperformance a year ago as supply recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns and caught up with demand (read: Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings).Apple stock has been struggling with concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Sales of its flagship product are facing significant headwinds in the crucial Chinese market due to rising competition from domestic smartphone makers as well as national security concerns. Additionally, consumers globally are holding their iPhone devices for longer before upgrading, further weighing on demand and sales growth.According to the preliminary data from research firm IDC, Apple lost its crown to South Korean rival Samsung as the world’s biggest mobile phone seller after its shipments fell about 10% in the quarter ended March. Samsung retook the lead in the global market with a 20.8% share, beating Apple’s 17.3% share, which has been dented by slowing sales in China.IDC revealed that Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones in the quarter ended March, down from the 55.4 million units in the year-ago quarter. It was the biggest drop in iPhone sales since COVID-19 lockdowns caused global supply chain chaos in 2022. A separate new report from market research firm Counterpoint Research shows that Apple’s iPhone sales dropped sharply by 19.1% year over year in the quarter ended March in China amid strong competition from domestic brand Huawei.Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index. It holds about 65 securities in its basket, with Apple making up 20.3% share.

It is worth mentioning that the company had generated approximately 47.5% of its fourth-quarter 2023 revenues outside the United States.A diversified clientele is likely to have boosted Cloudflare’s first-quarter top line. NET added around 7,764 new paying customers in the fourth quarter of 2023, bringing the total count to approximately 189,791.The company also added 198 new large customers (annual billings of more than $100,000), taking the total count to 2,756 at the end of the fourth quarter, up from 2,558 recorded at the end of the third quarter of 2023. This rise in customer base has prevailed for the past 10 quarters. This is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well, backed by the increasing demand for the company’s cloud-based offerings amid the continuing digitalizing trend.The company’s recurring subscription-based business model has been providing relative stability to its top line amid the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical issues.

2024-05-02 14:53:00,Is a Surprise Coming for Apple (AAPL) This Earnings Season?,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Apple Inc. AAPL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.52 per share for AAPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.93% heading into earnings season.Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. QuoteA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

2024-05-02 14:36:00,Top 20 Tech Companies in Silicon Valley,"In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 technology companies in Silicon Valley. If you want to skip our coverage of the world's technology hub and a region that has changed the world as we know it, then check out 5 Top Tech Companies in Silicon Valley. If there's one thing that 2024 has made sure it's that Silicon Valley isn't going anywhere. The sector that gave us the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the smartphone is now leading the charge with a set of technologies called artificial intelligence. Typically the domain of science fiction, AI is a collection of techniques that fall under the category of data science. It is the most advanced kind of data science there is, as the software is programmed to learn from voluminous data sets to generate and create insights of its own.The close of the first quarter of 2024 also provided Wall Street the ability to take stock of where some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most of which are in Silicon Valley, are when it comes to artificial intelligence. Big ticket technology and AI companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) report their earnings for the first quarter of 2024. These results primarily focused on the costs that the companies had incurred for their AI platforms in Q1 and also their plans for further spending this year.One of the first firms to report its earnings was the Facebook parent Meta. Its shares tanked by 16% in aftermarket hours on the day of the earnings report, as Wall Street digested a multi billion dollar AI capital expenditure plan for 2024 and saw costs grow for the first time after two consecutive quarters. Alphabet sought to assure investors of its stability, as it became yet another technology stock to declare a dividend. An additional source of income is almost always welcomed by investors, and Alphabet's shares soared by more than 10% in aftermarket, even as its peer Microsoft demonstrated mixed share price performance despite being one of the strongest performers on the artificial intelligence front.Delving deeper into Silicon Valley giant Alphabet's earnings, the firm known for being Google's parent, announced a 20 cent dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback. Both of these are great for helping the share price, and since its earnings report, Alphabet's stock is by 6% after shedding some of its 10% gains in post earnings gains during regular trading hours. On the revenue front, Alphabet brought in $80 billion while it raked in $1.81 on the EPS front. Both of these beat analyst estimates that had stood at $78.59 billion and $1.59, and coupled with $61.7 billion in advertising revenue that surged past estimates of $60.2 billion meant that the latest set of results was rather well rounded.On the hardware side of things, Intel, which is one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is currently focusing on the leading edge side of the industry. The firm has lost its chip manufacturing race to the Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and in April 2024, it announced the 'first light' for the world's most advanced chip making machine, a high NA EUV scanner. First light refers to the first time that a chip making machine is turned on, and the event typically marks the end of countless hours of work spent in setting up the complex machines.As for AI, here's what the management of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), another Silicon Valley firm, had to say during its Q1 2024 earnings:We’re bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud and will demonstrate our AI Assistant for Customer Experience Management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels. Adobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity.

2024-04-30 19:29:00,Apple Earnings: Time to Take a Bite?,"It’s another busy slate of earnings this week, with a wide variety of companies on the reporting docket. We’ve gotten through the big banks’ results and a few quarterly releases from ‘Mag 7’ members, whose results didn’t cause any meaningful spooks.And concerning this week’s docket, investor favorite Apple AAPL is slated to unveil quarterly results. Shares have been considerably weak year-to-date, losing roughly 10% compared to the S&P 500’s 8% gain.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIs the stock a buy heading into earnings? Let’s examine expectations and a few key metrics to watch in the release.Apple Apple’s woes in 2024 have primarily been fueled by fears concerning slowing growth and weakening demand from China, with its quiet-natured approach to artificial intelligence (AI) also causing some head-scratching.Shares faced pressure post-earnings following its latest release, with positivity surrounding its Services portfolio unable to excite the market. It’s worth noting that revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion throughout the quarter, down 13% from the year-ago period.For the quarter to be released, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in China stands at $16.6 billion, suggesting a 6.7% decrease from the year-ago period. As shown below, AAPL’s China revenue has fallen short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases, with the most recent miss totaling $2.5 billion.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcerning the Services portfolio, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $23.3 billion, 11.5% higher than the $20.9 billion reported in the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our Services expectations but modestly fell short in its latest release.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOf course, iPhone results will also be in focus. Our consensus estimate for iPhone sales stands at $46.2 billion, reflecting a nearly 10% pullback from the year-ago mark of $51.3 billion. The company snapped a streak of negative iPhone surprises in its latest release, with the beat totaling roughly $1 billion.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalysts have modestly lowered their earnings expectations since the beginning of February, with the $1.51 per share estimate down 2.6% and essentially flat compared to the year-ago figure. Revenue revisions have moved in a similar fashion, as the $90 billion expected is down the same amount over the same period. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWe have many investor favorites on the reporting docket for this week, a list that includes tech heavyweight Apple AAPL.Investors will be tuned into the company’s China results, which have recently faced pressure amid rising competition. The Services portfolio will undoubtedly be another major highlight, an area of the company that’s been a solid growth driver recently.Heading into the release, Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-04-30 19:16:00,15 Fastest Growing Cities in California,"In this article, we will take a look at the 15 fastest growing cities in California. If you want to skip our discussion on the economy of the state, you can go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Cities in California.California, the third largest state in the US by size, is known for its diverse population. The state ranks second only to Hawaii in the United States Census Bureau’s Diversity Index by State for 2020. Furthermore, California holds the title of the most populous state in the US and the eleventh most densely populated state. California is also home to Los Angeles, the second largest city in the US, as well as San Diego and San Jose, which are among the top 12 largest US cities by population.California is a bustling hub for business, with around 53 Fortune 500 companies. It holds the third position, following New York and Texas, in terms of the highest number of Fortune 500 companies. The state recorded a nominal GDP of $3.9 trillion in 2023. California’s economy is supported by over 1.7 million private-sector businesses as of 2022. These businesses contribute significantly, generating 90% of the state's economic output and creating around 15.6 million jobs.Silicon Valley, located in the San Francisco Bay Area, is known as the country’s technology hub. In 2023, the 20 largest tech companies in the Bay Area saw a reduction of approximately 7% in the region's workforce, amounting to roughly 18,800 workers. However, despite this decrease, by the end of the year, there was a net increase of about 37,000 individuals employed by technology firms in the Bay Area compared to pre-pandemic levels.Another measure of the region's well-being is its population dynamics. Silicon Valley experienced a decline in net migration starting in 2015. However, between mid-2022 and mid-2023, the area recorded a net increase of around 1,800 individuals, with more people coming in than leaving. This shift was due to a 52% decrease in the net number of individuals moving away, coupled with a roughly 37% increase in the number of foreign immigrants.Some of the prominent companies headquartered in California include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB).Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), based in Cupertino, is known for designing, developing, and retailing consumer electronics. The company is currently restructuring its supply chain to minimize emissions and its environmental impact. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) global operations are now powered by over 18 gigawatts of clean electricity. This reflects more than three times the amount recorded in 2020. Furthermore, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to restore 100 percent of the freshwater utilized in corporate operations, particularly in areas facing high water stress, by 2030. To achieve this goal, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has established partnerships to provide around 7 billion gallons of water benefits over the next two decades.Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB), formerly known as Trimble Navigation, specializes in producing cutting-edge products used in unmanned defense systems, mapping, machine controls, asset tracking, and mining. One of the company’s flagship offerings is Trimble Connect, which is a cloud-based collaboration platform. It is widely used by people in the design and construction sectors. Trimble Connect offers clients’ data security and facilitates real-time updates across the entire process chain. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) had approximately 12,700 employees as of 2023.Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was established in 1968. Based in Santa Clara, Silicon Valley, the company is known as one of the world's largest manufacturers of central processing units (CPUs) and semiconductors. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) recently introduced its newest AI chip, the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator. The company has positioned the chip as superior to Nvidia's H100. As of 2023, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) employed a workforce of 124,800 individuals.Here’s what Ariel Investments said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:“New holding, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue, outperformed in the quarter. Intel is benefitting from the near-term rebound in semiconductor demand driven by the cyclical recovery of personal computers (PCs) and central processing units (CPUs). Shares also traded higher following the company’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Everywhere launch event. Intel introduced its capabilities across cloud, edge and client hardware and showcased it can benefit from an enterprise upgrade cycle as both cloud-based and traditional enterprises look to incorporate AI features into core technology platforms. In our view, the market is also overlooking the progress Intel has made towards regaining its manufacturing technology advantage and believe the foundry business will continue to experience strong momentum as it grows its customer base and revenue.”Aerial view of a residential neighborhood in a metropolitan area in California.To shortlist the fastest growing cities in California, we used data from the US Census Bureau.

2024-04-30 17:28:00,What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?,"Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), now the world’s second most valuable company, has had a challenging year so far in 2024. The tech giant has lost significant market share in China to domestic rival Huawei, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker, accusing it of creating a monopoly over the smartphone market and engaging in anti-competitive practices. To make matters worse, Apple announced earlier this month that it would lay off 614 employees in California, according to eight reports filed with the California Employment Development Department.These developments have led some investors to question the stability of their investments in Apple, particularly in light of the fact that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) sold nearly $2 billion worth of its Apple shares during the 4th quarter of 2023. This begs the question: What would happen if Warren Buffett decided to completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple?It’s important to note that there is no indication that Buffett plans to sell any of Berkshire’s Apple shares, let alone all of them. In fact, during the company’s annual shareholders meeting last year, Buffett praised Apple, calling it “a better business than any we own.” However, for the sake of speculation, let’s explore the potential impact of such a move.As of the latest filings, Berkshire Hathaway owns 905,560,000 shares of Apple, representing a significant portion of the tech company’s 15.44 billion outstanding shares. If Buffett were to sell all of these shares, it could potentially flood the market with excess supply, putting downward pressure on Apple’s stock price.Given that Apple’s average daily trading volume is around 61.6 million shares, it would take approximately 15 trading days for the market to absorb Berkshire’s entire stake, assuming no other factors influenced the stock’s trading activity. During this hypothetical sell-off, Apple’s shares, which are already down 9.3% year-to-date, could experience further decline.The psychological impact of Buffett’s complete divestment could also be significant. Many investors look to Buffett as a beacon of long-term, value-oriented investing. If he were to lose faith in Apple, it could shake investor confidence and lead to a broader sell-off in the stock.However, it’s crucial to remember that Apple is still a fundamentally strong company with a loyal customer base and a history of innovation. Despite the challenges it faces, analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus price target of $196.77, representing a potential 17.51% upside from current levels.The truth is, no matter how strong a company may be, factors beyond its control – such as market sentiment, regulatory pressures, and competition – can significantly impact its stock price. This underscores the importance of diversification in an investor’s portfolio.For investors seeking to mitigate the risks associated with stock market volatility, alternative investments like real estate can provide a valuable diversification opportunity. Platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer unique ways to invest in real estate without the need to purchase and manage properties directly.Arrived allows investors to buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing exposure to the potential appreciation and rental income of the underlying properties. With an average dividend yield of 4.2% and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Click here to see properties available to invest in today with as little as $100Similarly, Cityfunds provides a way for investors to gain exposure to specific real estate markets through its city-specific funds. For example, you could own shares of a diversified portfolio of home equity investments in Miami, which have already seen a 14.7% increase in value.There's also the Cityfunds Yield fund, which targets an 8% annual yield, with a guaranteed 7% floor, by investing in a diversified pool of collateralized real estate loans.Click here to explore the Cityfunds available to invest in today with as little as $500.While it’s unlikely that Warren Buffett will completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple, the hypothetical scenario serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in any single stock investment. By diversifying into alternative assets like real estate, investors can potentially reduce their exposure to market volatility and build a more resilient portfolio.As always, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions. But for those looking to expand their investment horizons, platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer compelling opportunities to invest in real estate without the headaches of traditional property ownership.This article What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares? originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

2024-04-30 16:49:00,Apple's iPadOS will have to comply with EU's Digital Markets Act too,"The European Union will apply its flagship market fairness and contestability rules to Apple's iPadOS, the Commission said today. The move expands the number of Apple-owned platforms regulated under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to four and amps up regulatory risk for the tech giant by bringing its tablet ecosystem in scope.Apple has six months to ensure iPadOS is compliant with the DMA.The development could force significant changes on how Apple operates the tablet platform in the EU. The company will have to ensure it's complying with a sweep of DMA mandates, such as a ban on so-called gatekeepers being able to self-preference their own services and requirements to allow third-party app stores, the sideloading of apps, and support for third-party payment options.Apple will also need to open up access to non-WebKit versions of Safari on iPadOS in the next six months, similar to how it has already done on iOS. App developers who reach customers via iPadOS will have a legal right to FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms.Last fall, the Commission designated Apple's mobile platform iOS, App Store and Safari browser as subject to the DMA's set of upfront ""dos and dont's."" The regime brings tough penalties for any violations (of up to 10% of global annual turnover or even more for repeat offenses).Since then, Apple has announced a series of changes to how it operates the platforms in the region. But some aspects of its response to the DMA are already under investigation for suspected noncompliance. The Commission opened a first wave of formal DMA investigations last month.Apple's tablet operating system was not included in the EU's first DMA designations last year, as user numbers did not meet the threshold. However, the regulation gives the Commission leeway to consider qualitative criteria, too, where tech giants hold an entrenched and durable position. That is what happened in this case.The Commission said its investigation had revealed that business users of iPadOS exceed the threshold by elevenfold, and end user numbers are ""close"" to the threshold and predicted to rise in the near future.Its investigation also found that both end users and business users are ""locked-in"" to using iPadOS. ""Apple leverages its large ecosystem to disincentivise end users from switching to other operating systems for tablets,"" it wrote. ""Business users are locked-in to iPadOS because of its large and commercially attractive user base, and its importance for certain use cases, such as gaming apps.""""[D]espite not meeting the quantitative thresholds laid down in the DMA, [iPadOS] constitutes an important gateway for business users to reach end users and therefore should be designated as a gatekeeper,"" the Commission added.Apple responded to the designation of iPadOS with an emailed statement: “We will continue to constructively engage with the European Commission to comply with the DMA, across all designated services. Our focus will remain on delivering the very best products and services to our European customers, while mitigating the new privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users.""The Commission had allowed itself 12 months to investigate iPadOS. Assuming the body instigated the review right after announcing the first DMA designations, it took around eight months to conclude this qualitative look at the tablet platform. The Commission confirmed this is the first, and so far only, market investigation it has undertaken since the DMA kicked off.In a previous decision, back in February, the EU decided against designating Apple's iMessage as subject to the DMA, so the company avoided an obligation to make its messaging system interoperable with other platforms.EU confirms six (mostly US) tech giants are subject to Digital Markets ActApple, Google and Meta face first formal investigations under EU’s DMAThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/ipados-dma/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-ipados-comply-eus-digital-111246929.html,AAPL,0.063,0.024,0.9129999999999999,0.9568,Positive,174.35989379882812,173.33999633789062,-0.5849381063022617,-1
2024-04-30 16:47:00,Should You Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings?,"Apple AAPL is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $89.99 billion, indicating a decline of 5.11% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.51 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. However, the figure indicates a 0.66% decrease from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Apple has been one of the top performers in the past 12 months with consistent earnings performance. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.20% on average.However, Apple has been suffering from lower demand for the iPhone, a weak China market, stiff competition in the smartphone market and a worsening regulatory environment. These factors have hurt share price movement, which has declined 12.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 10.2%.Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. QuoteApple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 58.3% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales increased 6% year over year to $69.7 billion.The company expects the March quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2024) iPhone revenues to be like that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.Our model estimates for fiscal second-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $46.99 billion, suggesting an 8.5% decline year over year. Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 53.3 million iPhones in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 16% in the first quarter of calendar 2024, trailing Samsung’s 20%.However, Apple’s reported plan to integrate Gemini, Google’s generative AI service, into iOS can be a gamechanger for iPhone shipments.The weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit a worsening regulatory environment.Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $23.07 billion, indicating 10.3% year-over-year growth.PC segment witnessed growth in the first quarter of calendar 2024 after two years of decline. Per IDC’s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo LNVGY topped the shipment list, trailed by HP HPQ and Dell Technologies DELL, in terms of market share.Lenovo, HP, Dell and Apple had 23%, 20.1%, 15.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Moreover, in terms of shipment, Lenovo and HP witnessed growth of 7.8% and 0.2%, respectively, while Dell Technologies lost 2.2%. Apple witnessed 14.6% growth, the strongest on the list.Nevertheless, Mac sales are expected to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Mac net sales is pegged at $6.03 billion, indicating a 15.9% year-over-year decline.Apple’s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weak iPhone and Mac sales as well as weakness in China. Regulatory headwind, including the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit, is expected to remain an overhang on the shares.However, we believe the dip in Apple’s share price presents a buying opportunity, and it would be wise to buy ahead of the second-quarter fiscal earnings. Integration of AI into iPhone, solid Apple TV+ content, expanding installed base and strong Services business are key catalysts.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2024-04-30 14:40:00,Apple’s iPad will be subject to tough EU competition rules,"Apple’s iPad will face heightened regulation in the European Union after officials labeled its operating system Monday as a key gatekeeper technology under EU competition law.The European Commission’s formal designation of iPadOS subjects it to tough rules applied to only a handful of other digital platforms controlled by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.The stricter regulations require, for example, that the iPad not restrict third-party companies from accessing Apple services. And they prohibit Apple from giving its own services preferential treatment on the iPad compared to those offered by competitors. Violations can lead to hefty fines of up to 10% of a company’s global annual revenue. That could mean tens of billions of dollars in potential fines for Apple, which reported $383.3 billion in revenue last year.Apple is already subject to European gatekeeper obligations on iOS and in its app store and browser. But this move, telegraphed last fall when the European Commission launched a study of iPadOS, puts even more of the technology giant’s business under the EU’s microscope.Apple will have six months to comply with the new iPad-related obligations.In a statement, Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s top competition official, said iPadOS didn’t meet the statutory size or revenue thresholds that typically qualify a platform for gatekeeper status.Still, she said, “iPadOS constitutes an important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers.”“The Digital Markets Act is a dynamic tool which allows us to tackle the realities of digital markets,” Vestager added.“We will continue to constructively engage with the European Commission to comply with the DMA, across all designated services,” Apple said in a statement. “Our focus will remain on delivering the very best products and services to our European customers, while mitigating the new privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ipad-subject-tough-eu-144039750.html,AAPL,0.098,0.018000000000000002,0.884,0.9727,Positive,174.5749969482422,174.66009521484375,0.048745964822667215,0

2024-04-30 14:00:00,Apple Can Bounce Back,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) finds itself at a pivotal crossroads, nestled within the $160 to $168 price range that forms a critical demand zone. This strategic position could either serve as a springboard for resurgence or a potential pitfall if the stock dips below this support level.Investors and market watchers alike are keenly observing whether Apple can leverage its robust cash flows and innovative prowess to bounce back from recent setbacks and continue its legacy of growth and value creation.The $160 to $168 area is a crucial support level where the stock remains well supported for a potential bounce back. The stock has a higher chance of edging higher if it does not plummet below this demand zone. On the other hand, a sell-off followed by a close below this level could open the door for short sellers to push the stock lower.Nevertheless, Apple could bounce back given that it is in a critical demand zone whereby buyers on the fence could be enticed. Likewise, the Moving Average Convergence and Divergence Indicators have already started showing signs of bouncing back even as they remain below the zero line.Lastly, the pullback has made Apple relatively cheap compared to its peers trading at a premium valuation. The company's boasts of solid cash flows, buybacks, and a reputation for generating long-term value should continue to fuel optimism of a potential bounce back after the recent slide from 52-week highs.AAPL Data by GuruFocusThere is no denying that Apple is in a difficult period as it deals with a high-profile antitrust probe over claims it blocks rivals from accessing hardware and software features in its devices. Yet, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), history offers some guidance that the market reaction in the very early going of such regulatory pressures may be worse than the ultimate effects. Apple has been leading efforts to meet these concerns with various compromises, including changes to its payment system and adopting right-to-repair policies, which may open up new business opportunities.Next, the growing concerns over slowing iPhone sales in China and other key markets have rattled the stock's sentiment on Wall Street. Even though the iPhone remains the company's flagship product, its lack of significant upgrades and updates from previous versions has made it difficult to ship more products as expected. With customers opting to hold on to their older-generation iPhones rather than upgrading, Apple has yet to generate as much revenue as it would have expected.Apple's amazing return on equity and return on invested capital have effectively placed a target on its back in the fiercely competitive technological scene. The most recent reports of smartphone sales have seen Apple just beaten by Samsung (XKRX:005930), marking the beginning of heightened competition within the smartphone sector.The current state of tensions around the world and threats of hardware and software bans could ripple across tech giants such as Apple, which relies on international markets. Chinese companies are taking an ever-greater share, partly due to nationalistic preferences at the expense of foreign companies, and this is likely to impact Apple's sales in this all-important market.However, CEO Tim Cook has managed a tightrope of strategic relations with China, forging ahead with diversification in manufacturing to other Asian nations such as India, Indonesia and Vietnam to spread out risk and open up new growth opportunities.Finally, despite these risks, Apple is in very healthy financial condition. It has the highest rating from every major credit agency, a ""wide moat"" status. Therefore, its financial health underlines the company's ability to weather market volatility and invest in innovation.With new products such as the Vision Pro, which was recently launched and not well-accepted, the company is sticking to its guns on an innovation drive. Exiting from the car project definitely means gearing the company's efforts toward new and high-potential profit markets, such as home robotics, where its technological advantage of vision recognition and voice command can really shine.Additionally, as per former software engineer and tech expert Vance Tran, mature businesses can leverage Apple's innovative spirit and new product ventures to access new markets and revenue streams. Specifically, companies in the automotive supply chain and software development sectors stand to benefit significantly from the Apple Car and the increasing demand for apps and services within Apple's ecosystem.Indeed, the company's first-quarter earnings registered an upsurge of 16%, with solid contributions to revenue from the Americas and Europe, while performance was weaker in China. The company's strategy in emerging markets could offset these challenges, where a rapidly increasing middle class with a huge appetite for quality consumer tech can offset an overly competitive landscape.Additionally, Apple plans to continue growing earnings per share by 10% or better annually with constant product enhancements, its highly efficient operations and a strong brand that can command premium pricing. Together, these things enable Apple to be well-positioned for long-term, sustained growth.A possible increase in the dividend accompanying the second-quarter earnings and a conservative dividend policy maintained by Apple alongside the robust business model ensure that shareholder returns can indeed be grown, mostly regarding capital gains. The fact that peers against which comparison is made, including Microsoft and Samsung, are priced appropriately with respect to Apple means that there is good investment potential here, mostly based on the potential to earn from the company and its robust market position.Lastly, with a persistent forecast for long-term earnings growth, Apple makes a strong case for investors looking for sustained returns from this global leader in technology. Therefore, with an earnings per share estimate of $6.57 in 2024 and a price-earnings multiple of 30, the stock can easily get back on track and reach $197 by year's end.As Apple continues exploring new growth areas to offset losses on its iPhone product line, it still generates optimum shareholder value. The company already has a $77 billion buyback program, the biggest in the industry, which underlines its robust financial health and management confidence about its prospects.While Apple has yet to detail the number of shares it intends to repurchase, any buyback should result in a reduction in shares in circulation, in return increasing earnings per share, all else equal. The same earnings shared among small shares will always be worth more. By reducing the share count by 2% to 3% a year, the company should increase shareholders' return by a comparable amount annually.If the management team had not been confident about long-term prospects amid the iPhone headwinds, the buyback program could have been cut and the amount redirected to other projects. Therefore, the $77 billion buyback program underscores the company's stability and growth potential.Over the past decade, the company has spent nearly $658 billion on buybacks. Yet it continues to finance its research and development operations as one of the ways of staying ahead of the pack with unique products and services. In contrast, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) has spent nearly $240 billion on buybacks, opting to dedicate a good chunk of its cash flows toward research and development investments.Given that Apple has been able to maintain its edge while offering one of the most sought-after smartphones and growing its software offering, this affirms the company's commitment to innovation.Amid fluctuations in its iconic iPhone line and challenging market conditions, Apple stands resilient, backed by strategic shifts toward high-potential markets like home robotics and sustained financial maneuvers, including a $77 billion buyback program.As Apple adapts to changing consumer trends and regulatory landscapes, it continues to drive shareholder value through innovative products and a robust business model aimed at long-term growth. Thus, investors should watch closely as Apple navigates these waters, bolstering its position with solid cash flows and a legacy of strategic foresight.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-bounce-back-140003542.html,AAPL,0.142,0.033,0.826,0.9991,Positive,175.42999267578125,174.52999877929688,-0.5130216804760903,-1

2024-04-26 16:30:00,Congo questions Apple over knowledge of conflict minerals in its supply chain,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Congo ’s government is questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into its supply chains and is demanding answers within three weeks.A group of international lawyers representing Congo said Thursday that they sent letters to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook and its French subsidiary this week, raising concerns about human rights violations involving the minerals extracted from mines in the country’s troubled east that might end up being used in the company’s products.They included a list of questions challenging Apple to show how it monitors its supply chains in a region where more than 100 armed rebel groups operate, some of whom have been accused of carrying out mass killings of civilians.Writing to Cook, the lawyers said “it has become clear to us that year after year, Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave violations of human rights.”""The iPhones, Mac computers and accessories that Apple sells to its customers around the world rely on supply chains that are too opaque, and that are tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,"" the lawyers said.Eastern Congo is one of the most mineral-rich regions in the world but is also the site of a huge humanitarian disaster, with the armed groups fighting for years for control of the mines and the valuable minerals in them, and millions of people displaced and affected by the worsening violence. The situation has deteriorated badly in the last few months.Apple, which has a market value of around $2.6 trillion, has denied using minerals from mines and regions where human rights violations take place, saying it conducts business ethically and “responsibly” sources minerals in Congo and neighboring countries.The minerals it buys don't finance war or armed groups, it says. The lawyers for the Congo government said “those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence.”The Congo government said it has suspicions that some of the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — known as the 3TG critical minerals — that Apple sources from suppliers is smuggled out of Congo to neighboring Rwanda and then infiltrated into the global supply chain. The 3TG minerals are key components in electronics.In response to a request for comment, Apple pointed to a section from a company filing on conflict minerals.“Based on our due diligence efforts, including analyzing the information provided by third-party audit programs, upstream traceability programs, and our suppliers, we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,"" the report said, using the abbreviation for Democratic Republic of the Congo.“In Congo, people have been dying for 30 years as a result of illegal mining,” Congo government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said. “We want clarification on the sources of supply for major technology companies, in particular Apple, to verify whether they are acquiring minerals produced in completely illegal conditions.”He said Rwanda “is presented” as the supplier for many of the minerals while having few reserves of its own.Congo has accused Rwanda of financing and directing the notorious armed rebel group M23 in eastern Congo to help extract minerals illegally. The United Nations also says M23 is backed by Rwanda.Rwanda denies that but tensions between the countries are flaring, while M23 and other groups are accused of regularly carrying out attacks that include the killing and raping of civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.The lawyers for the Congo government quoted a 2022 report by nonprofit group Global Witness that claimed Apple had previously applied “few meaningful mitigation measures” to avoid using smuggled minerals.The Congo government was now seeking “effective redress” against “end-users of blood minerals” across the world, the lawyers said.They asked Apple to respond to questions over its supply chain controls within three weeks and said they had compiled a report on “the laundering” of Congo's minerals by Rwanda and private entities that would be made public this month.They also would seek instructions from the Congo government as to what legal measures it is considering against Apple, the letter said.___AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London and AP writer Saleh Mwanamilongo in Kinshasa, Congo, contributed to this report.___AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/congo-questions-apple-over-knowledge-135136596.html,AAPL,0.042,0.14,0.818,-0.9977,Negative,169.1199951171875,170.18499755859375,0.6297318307443676,1
2024-04-26 16:07:00,RevenueCat raises $12M Series C as it expands its subscription management to the web,"RevenueCat, a top subscription management platform for apps that monetize via in-app purchases, is now flush with new capital as it expands to the web. The company has closed on a $12 million Series C led by Adjacent, following the launch of a new product, RevenueCat Billing, that allows web app developers to integrate subscription purchases into any website. Later, it will also support Roku.The timing of the product's launch is notable, as it arrives amid the implementation of the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulation, which is forcing Apple to open the iPhone and the App Store to new competition. As a result, Apple initially blocked iPhone web apps (Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs) in the EU, likely fearing developers would abandon its App Store, before reversing that decision under regulatory pressure.For RevenueCat, however, the changes ahead for iOS — not to mention Apple's refusal to cut its default 15%-30% commission rate — mean there are now more developers looking to the web to monetize their apps.""It could be for progressive web apps or any kind of customer that wants to take payments outside of the App Store,"" said RevenueCat CEO Jacob Eiting of the new web billing product. ""It's going to play within all the new [DMA] rules … it's going to be a pretty significant product expansion for us.""The company says it moved in this direction because of the inbound interest from developers. Even if they didn't have a web app, many developers wanted to shift their customers to the web to pay.Apple reverses decision about blocking web apps on iPhones in the EUThough Stripe already enables this functionality, what developers were lacking was a system that's specifically designed for consumer subscription apps. Now, even if developers are processing payments through Stripe or others, they're getting their data and insights in the same format and within the same dashboard where they already manage their in-app purchase data. This makes it easier for them to focus on how their subscription apps are monetizing overall, regardless of where the payment comes from, web or mobile.Though Apple has historically not allowed app developers to steer customers to the web from inside their iOS apps, it has permitted steering from other channels, like the developer's website or emails to customers. The EU's DMA rules should also permit developers to steer customers to the web from inside their mobile apps, too.With RevenueCat Billing, essentially a web SDK, developers can accept subscription payments from any website. It joins other recent product releases like Paywall, Targeting and Experiments, which are all designed to help developers grow their revenue. RevenueCat powers subscriptions in over 30,000 apps and handles over $2 billion in subscriptions annually, it says.The new Series C from Adjacent (led by Nico Wittenborn, a Series A investor, now board member) totals $12 million. Other investors include Y Combinator, Index Ventures, Volo Ventures and SaaStr Fund. Ahead of this round, RevenueCat had raised $56 million, bringing its total raise to more than $68 million.In addition to fueling its new products, the fundraise will help RevenueCat expand to new markets, including Japan and South Korea.""Our main competitor is ‘cobbling together monetization technology yourself’,"" said RevenueCat CTO and co-founder Miguel Carranza in a statement about the fundraise and expansions. ""In the U.S., we’ve done a good job at educating developers, product people, marketers, and CEOs on the challenges of building in-house. In many other regions, it’s unfortunately still the default for businesses to sink valuable resources into something that provides zero differentiation or value for that business’s end users. We’re investing in those regions by expanding our support for languages and local currencies later this year, deepening our relationships with local technology partners and agencies, as well as hiring in-market where possible.""Image Credits: RevenueCatRevenueCat is not yet a profitable company, but Eiting says that profitability is always on the horizon. The company still has the money it raised in 2021 and now has over $40 million in the bank in addition to around $20 million in ARR. It has also halved its burn rate since last summer.""There's so much stuff we can build by deploying capital and doing it on a profitable basis would just slow us down right now. So while there's access to capital, which isn't always the case … the best thing for our customers and investors is to take more capital and deploy it faster,"" Eiting told TechCrunch.""RevenueCat is too important to too many apps to risk the company driving towards a financial cliff. This may be counter to the prevailing narrative of how venture-backed companies should be built, but our investors are aligned with us and know that Miguel and I are leading the company to maximize the value for developers. Investors make more money when developers make more money,"" the CEO said in a blog post. ""To that end, we’re still aiming to take the company public in this decade.""This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/25/revenuecat-raises-12m-series-c-as-it-expands-its-subscription-management-to-the-web/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/revenuecat-raises-12m-series-c-150300536.html,AAPL,0.06,0.018000000000000002,0.922,0.9791,Positive,168.75999450683594,170.39520263671875,0.9689548371113365,1

2024-04-26 14:15:00,Have $500? 4 Absurdly Cheap Stocks Long-Term Investors Should Buy Right Now,"One tried-and-true path to great returns as an investor is to buy shares of strong companies that have fallen out of favor on Wall Street. These businesses are often enduring challenges that threaten the next year or two of earnings, but not the wider growth picture. In that way, you expose yourself to short-term paper losses in exchange for impressive gains over many years. In effect, you're being paid to be patient.Of course, many stocks are cheap for reasons that do impair the company's long-term growth prospects. The challenge is to avoid these situations while singling out the truly temporary corporate stumbles. Let's look at a few attractive candidates that fit the bill.Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) stock missed most of the pandemic-era rally in 2021 and then was left out of the post-pandemic market surge over the past year. As a result, shares of the beverage titan have risen by just 24% in the past five years compared to the 73% increase in the S&P 500 over that time.Yet, Coke remains a formidable business with sales volumes rising along with prices in 2023. Earnings are stellar and profit margin is well above that of rival PepsiCo. The company generates enough cash to pay one of the most stable, longest-running dividends on the market.And its growth prospects are solid as rising demand for waters, energy drinks, and other new niches offset declines in the more traditional soda portfolio.Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) is playing a game that's stacked in its favor. The video game publisher owns a huge collection of intellectual property that spans popular niches like sports and casual games. Steady growth in its audience size (and monetization rates) has helped annual revenue rise to $8 billion from less than $4 billion a decade ago.Games are becoming more profitable as the selling model shifts to more of a software-as-a-service approach. EA is a leader in this arena, with subscription services accounting for 70% of annual sales. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth following the pandemic spike, but savvy investors can look past that volatility toward EA's much brighter potential in 2025 and beyond.Fears about a recent growth slowdown should have investors salivating at the discounted price of McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) stock. The fast-food chain noted that customer traffic dropped into negative territory at the start of 2024, which is never great news for a restaurant business. Fewer guests means fewer opportunities to sell new menu items or those core sandwiches (like the Big Mac) that have been staples for decades.McDonald's has been through many similar challenges in its years sitting at the top of the fast-food industry. It will emerge from this slump, too, with help from promotions and a deeper push into the drive-thru and home delivery segments.In the meantime, investors can collect its tasty dividend payment and marvel at McDonald's industry-leading profit margin. The chain is aiming to push operating profit toward 50% of sales over the next few years, in fact.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares haven't budged in the past year even as the wider market rallied over 20%. There's no shortage of concerns about this member of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" including sluggish growth in China, flat demand for its hardware products, and relatively weak profitability when compared to rivals like Microsoft.It would be a mistake to bet against the iPhone maker over the long term. It has the biggest installed base in the industry, with 2.2 billion users interacting with its brand through the tech titan's hardware. That's a huge audience it can market to for its next several product launches, whether they're iterative updates or revolutionary entries into new categories.Apple looks cheap at its current valuation sitting below 7 times annual sales. Toss in ample cash generation ($40 billion just this past quarter), and you've got a recipe for crisp investor returns from here.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-26 14:02:00,Apple (AAPL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Apple (AAPL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 2, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.Revenues are expected to be $89.99 billion, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?For Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.93%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of +4.31%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Apple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

2024-04-25 18:54:00,"Apple looks to Southeast Asia, India as hedge against China difficulties","Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook toured Southeast Asia last week, visiting Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, as part of a multiday trip geared toward reducing Apple’s reliance on China as its central manufacturing hub.And while Apple isn’t looking to abandon China — Cook spent a number of days in the country just last month — the company is hedging against the potential for future manufacturing roadblocks in the region.At the same time, the company is slowly setting its sights on India as its next major growth opportunity now that China has become a more mature smartphone market.“Apple is in the beginning stages of a decade[-long] transition away from reliance on China and diversify that to other countries in Southeast Asia on both the manufacturing front and the demand front,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.But reducing Apple’s dependence on China for building its devices and growing its market share could take some time.China accounts for a disproportionate amount of Apple’s supply chain partners such as Foxconn and Pegatron. That concentration of manufacturing capacity in one area proved especially damaging during the pandemic when China forced factories to shut down, limiting Apple’s ability to build and ship devices.Once capacity came back online, Apple was able to meet consumer demand again. But the fact that a factory closure had such an impact on the company was a troubling sign of fragility in its supply chain.“Apple basically said they fulfilled about $5 billion of back revenue on the last conference call,” BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told Yahoo Finance. “That's $5 billion for one facility shut down in China.”Left unchecked, that lack of supply chain resiliency could come back to bite Apple again given the gloomy state of the US and China’s relationship and tit-for-tat maneuvers the countries are making with regard to their respective tech companies. The US has tried to box out Huawei from getting access to high-end processors and is working to get ByteDance to sell TikTok, while China is reportedly requiring state employees to ditch devices made by Western companies.“We see Cupertino going aggressively after [Southeast Asian] countries on the supply front,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “Cook is hedging his bets as China remains a very dicey situation for Apple while Vietnam and Indonesia are soft landing spots for iPhone production.”Apple’s problems in China extend beyond manufacturing complexities. The company is also contending with a slowdown in iPhone sales in the region as economic growth flags and regional rivals grab market share.Greater China is Apple’s third-largest market by revenue behind the Americas and Europe. But iPhone sales in the region are slowing. In Q1, Apple reported revenue in Greater China fell 13% year over year, and that’s after falling 2% for all of 2023. Apple previously reported 9% growth in the region in 2022.China is also a relatively mature smartphone market, making massive growth gains a difficult proposition, which is where India comes in.The most populous country in the world, India has a growing middle class that could prove to be a boon for Apple.“China took probably five years before it really mattered,” Munster explained. “India probably takes 10 years, and the reason is they've got the population on their side, but the GDP per capita is about a quarter in India what it is in China. And so just in general, people don't have … the same wealth in India as they do in China.”Apple opened its first official store in India last year, with Cook himself kicking off the festivities for the Mumbai location. Apple also builds some of its latest iPhones in the country, making it even more important for the company.Emerging markets like India are going to be key to Apple’s growth in the coming years, as its larger markets continue to mature and growth declines. The company has been telegraphing that much as well. In earnings calls, executives repeatedly point to emerging markets as growth areas during earnings calls, with Tim Cook specifically pointing to the likes of India and other growth markets in his opening remarks during Apple’s Q1 call.Still, Apple’s push to expand its manufacturing and market share outside of China will take years. So, for the foreseeable future, the company will have to continue to rely on China and figure out how to make the best of it.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

2024-04-25 14:53:00,"Steve Jobs Spent 'Hour After Hour' On Product Design — 'He Cared About God Being In The Details,' Says Walter Isaacson","Steve Jobs dedicated “hour after hour” to the minutiae of product design at Apple Inc., driven by a belief of “God being in the details,” according to esteemed biographer Walter Isaacson, chronicler of some of the most influential figures in technology.This philosophy was evident in Jobs’s hands-on involvement in creating iconic Apple products. Isaacson noted how Jobs's obsession with design extended to every aspect of a product, even those components that consumers would never see. This approach wasn't just about aesthetics; for Jobs, the care put into the unseen parts of a product was a testament to the integrity and quality of the entire creation.Don't Miss:Join the elite. Invest in Epic Games and own a piece of the $17 billion Fortnite empire.This ‘Future of Gaming’ startup disrupting a $272 billion industry is now letting anyone invest for a limited time.During an interview posted on YouTube, Isaacson highlighted Jobs’s sessions in Apple’s design studio, where he would scrutinize everything from the curvature of a computer’s casing to the layout of internal components.Jobs believed that true excellence in product design required a relentless pursuit of perfection, down to the smallest detail. This could mean countless revisions and discussions, often pushing his team to their limits but also driving them to innovate in ways they never thought possible.Jobs's detailed-oriented methodology set a new standard in the tech industry, emphasizing the importance of design in product development. His legacy, detailed by Isaacson, shows a leader who demanded the best and deeply understood the elements that would appeal to users, both aesthetically and functionally.Trending: Invest alongside execs from Uber, Facebook and Apple in this wellness app Transforming a $5.6 TRILLION dollar industry.This detail-oriented approach to products helped make Apple into the powerhouse it is today. In its early days, Apple was dedicated to innovation, with the near-flawless design of the iPhone and iPad going largely unchanged since their inception over a decade ago. Although some now accuse Apple of incrementalism, it's hardly impacted the company and leaves opportunities for new and exciting startups to take the helm.Isaacson’s observations offer a window into Jobs’s mind, revealing how his focus on details was integral to Apple’s success. This approach led to groundbreaking products like the iPhone and MacBook, which seamlessly blend functionality with sleek, minimalist design.Through Isaacson’s narrative, it becomes clear that Jobs’s insistence on perfection in every aspect of design was not just about making products that looked good, but about creating devices that offer a revolutionary user experience, fundamentally changing how people interact with technology.Jobs’s legacy, as articulated by Isaacson, is a reminder of the importance of detail in crafting products that are both functional and transformative. His philosophy continues to influence Apple and the broader tech industry, perpetuating a culture where design and detail are paramount.Keep Reading About Startups:Invest like a millionaire.

2024-04-25 14:20:00,"Apple Stock Has 35% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are down 13% year to date. The company is facing several headwinds right now, including weak iPhone sales in China and increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe.Despite these headwinds, Wells Fargo has an overweight (buy) rating on the shares with a $225 price target. That's 35% higher than Apple's current share price of $166.90.In the company's fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30, 2023), iPhone sales grew in every region except China. But analysts expect Apple to report a 5% year-over-year decline in revenue for the fiscal second quarter.Apple is expected to launch generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for iOS later this year, which could stimulate iPhone demand, but investors are worried about the cost of these new features. Analysts expect Apple to post earnings per share of $1.50 for fiscal Q2, slightly down from $1.52 in the year-ago period.Another cloud hanging over Apple stock right now is regulation. In March, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit alleging that Apple is monopolizing the smartphone market with certain contractual restrictions placed on app developers. Meanwhile, the European Union is trying to force Apple to offer users alternative ways to buy content in the App Store.Overall, these headwinds may continue to negatively impact investor sentiment around the stock in the near term, but these issues don't impact the value of Apple's brand.The stock's valuation still isn't cheap on a price-to-earnings basis, and with Apple likely facing another quarter of soft iPhone sales, investors shouldn't expect the stock to reach the analyst's price target anytime soon. However, stronger iPhone sales in calendar 2025, especially if Apple releases new AI features, may be the catalyst that sends the share price higher.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-24 16:51:00,UPDATE 3-Apple announces event on May 7 amid reports of launch of new iPads,"(Adds details in paragraphs 4, 6 and 8)April 23 (Reuters) - Apple will hold an event on May 7, the company said on Tuesday, amid reports that it would roll out the long-anticipated revamped versions of iPad Pro and iPad Air next month.The Cupertino, California-based company did not disclose details about the event that would start at 7 a.m. PT (2 p.m. GMT).Bloomberg News reported in March that Apple's overseas suppliers had ramped up production of the new iPads and a launch was planned for early May.The new models would represent Apple's first overhaul to that lineup since 2018. Apple had introduced iPad in January 2010.The potential launch comes at a time of a decline in iPad sales. The sales dropped 25% to $7.02 billion in the first quarter, while those of iPhone, its most popular product, have also been slowing.It is a safe bet that there will be new iPads launched that day, given the picture of an Apple pencil and art on the invite, said Ben Bajarin, CEO of consulting firm Creative Strategies.The tablet market is under duress as economic uncertainty looms and consumers cut back on non-essential spending, but Apple expects to combat the slump in demand with new products.The company already sells five iPad models including the Pro, Air, Mini and the ninth and 10th generations of its regular iPad, according to the company's website.Apple's iPad sales contributed just 5.9% to the company's total net sales of $119.58 billion in the first quarter ended Dec. 30.Apple is also scheduled to hold its Worldwide Developers Conference from June 10 to June 14.

2024-04-24 16:10:00,Will Apple (AAPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Apple (AAPL), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry.This maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.67%.For the last reported quarter, Apple came out with earnings of $2.18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 4.31%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.46 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.04%.For Apple, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Apple has an Earnings ESP of +1.80% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 2, 2024.With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

2024-04-24 16:00:00,Why I Sold These 3 Tech Stocks in 2024,"Buying a stock is usually easier than selling a stock. Investors often get greedy and refuse to take profits from their winners, preferring to hold on and hope for more gains. They can also stubbornly stick with their losers because they aren't able to admit they made a mistake.So today, I'll share with you three stocks I recently sold: Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Unity (NYSE: U). All three initially seemed like good investments, but some significant challenges forced me to reconsider their growth prospects and ultimately cut them from my portfolio.I bought most of my shares in Adobe in early 2022. At the time, I admired its robust revenue growth, pricing power, and the stickiness of its cloud-based subscriptions. However, I sold all of my remaining shares in March for three reasons: Its growth was cooling off, the company is facing existential challenges, and management didn't seem to have a clear plan for the future.Adobe's revenue only rose 10% in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Dec. 1, 2023), compared to its 12% growth in its fiscal 2022 and 23% growth in fiscal 2021. On average, analysts expect its revenue will grow by 11% in fiscal 2024 -- but a lot of that growth will be driven by its recent price hikes rather than growth in the number of customers or the expansion of its new generative AI platform.Some of Adobe's slowdown can be blamed on macroeconomic headwinds, but it also faces fierce competition from nimbler competitors like Canva in the image editing market, Figma in the software design market, and generative AI platforms like OpenAI's DALL-E. Adobe tried to buy Figma for $20 billion to widen its moat, but that deal was scuttled by regulators in December over anti-competitiveness concerns. U.S. regulators have also been probing Adobe's subscription cancellation policies.All those headwinds make Adobe a tough stock to love, even if it looks reasonably valued at 26 times forward earnings. The company is not doomed yet, but I wouldn't touch its stock again unless it overcomes its competitive and regulatory challenges.When I invested in Qualcomm back in early 2022, the mobile chipmaker was still growing revenues rapidly as consumers bought new 5G smartphones. In its fiscal 2022 (which ended Sept. 25, 2022), its revenue surged 32%. But in its fiscal 2023, its revenue dropped by 19% as the 5G upgrade cycle ended and the Chinese smartphone market stalled out.That cyclical slowdown wasn't surprising, but Qualcomm also clearly faced two longer-term threats. First, its Taiwanese competitor MediaTek continued to gain ground in the low-end to mid-range smartphone market. Second, Apple is plotting to replace Qualcomm's baseband modems with in-house designed modems by 2026.Qualcomm is trying to diversify its business away from smartphones with new automotive and Internet of Things chips, but its gains in those smaller businesses aren't yet offsetting the declines in its sales of handset chips. TSMC's recent first-quarter earnings report also suggested the smartphone market will remain weak throughout most of this year.As a result, analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and adjusted EPS to only grow by 7% and 16%, respectively, in fiscal 2024. That's a decent outlook for a stock that trades at 17 times forward earnings, but there simply aren't enough catalysts on the horizon for the company. Any gloomy news about Apple, China, or the smartphone industry would also likely drag down its stock for the rest of the year.I originally invested in Unity in early 2022. Roughly half of the world's PC, mobile, and console games were created using Unity's game development engine, so it seemed like a great way to profit from the growth of the video game market. Management also repeatedly insisted the company could grow its revenues by more than 30% annually over the long term.Unfortunately, I overlooked the disruptive challenges to its advertising business, which helped developers monetize their games with integrated ads. In 2022, Apple's user privacy update on iOS rendered Unity's targeted advertising algorithm obsolete. That setback forced Unity to merge with ironSource, a controversial adtech company previously known for developing malware, in a dilutive all-stock deal to reboot its advertising business.In September, Unity tried to implement new ""runtime fees"" that it would charge each time a game was installed after a developer exceeded certain revenue thresholds. That move was meant to boost its near-term revenues, but the backlash from its developers was so severe that it backtracked on those fees and ousted CEO John Riccitiello a month later. Unity's revenue still rose 58% in 2023, but most of that growth came from its merger with ironSource.As Unity laps that merger and shuts down its struggling Weta Digital division, analysts expect its revenue to decline by 17% in 2024 and only rise 12% in 2025. Those aren't impressive growth rates for a stock that still trades at 5 times this year's sales -- and it isn't expected to turn a profit anytime soon. This certainly isn't the same company I originally invested in, so I liquidated all of my shares at a loss this February.Before you buy stock in Adobe, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Adobe wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-24 16:00:00,Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings,"Apple Inc. AAPL has been an underperformer this year, with a year-to-date loss of 10.7%, underperforming other mega-cap technology companies. Its lesser exposure to AI within the “Magnificent Seven” group and concerns over the sales growth of iPhone in the key China market can be held responsible for this lackluster performance.Plus, rising rates have played a role in pushing the stock down in recent trading. Apple's stock recorded a 3.4% drop over the last five days. Apple is expected to come up with 2Q24 earnings results on May 2. Just prior to the earnings release, the stock is caught between bullish and bearish commentaries from Wall Street watchers.Let’s delve a little deeper:Bank of America named Apple a top pick for 2024, citing optimism over upcoming results and longer-term prospects. Analyst Wamsi Mohan, with a buy rating and $225 price target, highlighted Apple's ""rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows.""BofA has positive expectations about Apple's second-quarter results, with expectations of strong services revenue growth and margins. However, the bank warned about a potential pullback in shares due to a weak demand environment.Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on the stock to $210 from $220 on Monday, expecting Apple to give a disappointing forecast when it reports. The firm suggests buying on post-earnings weakness, anticipating an upcoming Apple event focused on AI. Bloomberg Intelligence is still cautious, particularly regarding weaker iPhone demand in China.UBS Global Research also downgraded its rating on Apple with the other big five tech stocks. UBS downgraded because of tough comps and cyclical forces that hurt these stocks.The company saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter. The iPhone maker has a decent track of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average beat of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.Despite Apple's prominence in benchmark equity indexes, Wall Street is fairly skeptical, with only 55% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommending the stock compared to higher percentages for other tech giants.However, some strategists find AAPL attractive given the stock's relatively cheaper valuation and potential benefits from a rotation to less rate-sensitive stocks amid high inflation and rising yields.Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations.Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.14% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.Based on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $205.24. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00. The average price target represents an increase of 24.39% from the last closing price of $165.00.Investors intending to follow bullish comments from Wall Street analysts but still wary of slowing sales of Apple may take the ETF route. This is because ETFs help investors mitigate one company’s average performance with the other big tech companies’ stellar presence.Below, we highlight a few ETFs with heavy exposure to Apple for investors seeking to bet on the stock with much lower risk.Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK – AAPL holds the second spot with 19.10% weight.

2024-04-24 14:33:00,Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimates,"Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent ""efficiency"" strategy.Over the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.The audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, ""driven by share price appreciation during the quarter"", according to Spotify.It also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates — 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.On top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.According to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise ""later this year."" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.The stock moved as much as 15% higher in early trading on Tuesday following the results.The streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.Gross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.Spotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.Revenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion) — 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023 and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.Total monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter — but it was still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.Premium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million — a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects the subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.Free cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.Overall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.Spotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.That spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.Spotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.In addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of ""Call Her Daddy.""The new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.The audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.Cooper's ""Call Her Daddy"" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Year to date, it has climbed more than 8%, outperforming a US banking sector-wide index (^BKX).""We feel very good about our first quarter results,"" Solomon told analysts last week.

2024-04-23 14:15:00,Can Apple Afford Its $108 Billion in Long-Term Debt?,"In the past 10 years, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have crushed the Nasdaq Composite index. Strong financial results have propelled this business to a $2.6 trillion market capitalization.Despite this impressive performance, some investors might worry that this dominant tech enterprise carries $108 billion of long-term debt on its balance sheet. That gargantuan figure alone would qualify as the world's 139th-most-valuable company.Can Apple afford this massive amount of debt?Investors can look at some key metrics to determine whether a business is able to handle its debt burden. When scrutinizing Apple in this regard, it's clear that the company has absolutely no problem at all with its borrowings.Apple's debt ratio of 31% (comparing its debt to assets) has actually come down in recent years. And it demonstrates that there are ample assets backing the company. The business generated an incredible $114 billion in operating income in fiscal 2023. But it only made $3.9 billion in interest payments. This shows that even if a severe recession happened that crushed demand for its popular hardware devices, lowering revenue in the process, Apple could still easily make good on its payments.Just because a company has some debt on the books, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a risky stock to own. In fact, in this case, it points to Apple's financial prowess. The tech giant started borrowing aggressively about a decade ago to take advantage of ultra-low interest rates. This has helped to fund its buybacks and dividends.Moreover, you'd struggle to find a more profitable enterprise than this one. In the past three fiscal years, Apple generated over $300 billion in free cash flow. Based on this result, one could even make a valid argument that Apple would be able to take on even more debt. In any case, the tech titan's balance sheet is doing just fine right now.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-23 13:44:00,Alphabet’s Cash Boom Is Raising Dividend Hopes on Wall Street,"(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. is bringing in so much cash that hopes are rising it will take a page out of the Meta Platforms Inc. playbook and start paying a dividend.Most Read from BloombergTrump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial UnderwayTikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US ClaimsRay Dalio’s Famous Trade Is Sputtering and Investors Are BailingUS Dollar’s Extended Reign Delivers Stark Wake-Up Call for MarketsS&P 500 Tops 5,000 as Earnings Kick Into High Gear: Markets WrapThe search giant has been plowing excess cash into share buybacks for years and many investors expect another $70 billion to be earmarked when Alphabet reports earnings on April 25. But analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Truist Securities are among those that see a small dividend as a way to move the needle further for the stock, similar to Meta’s February move that helped fuel a 20% jump in shares.“A dividend would be well received,” said Andrew Zamfotis, portfolio manager at Ami Asset Management Corp. “While investors are still looking for growth from these companies, today there is also value in cost discipline and the decision to initiate a dividend suggests that management will be prudent and attempt to allocate capital in a way that balances growth and capital return.”Dividends have traditionally been seen as the province of more mature and slower-growing companies but the policy has been gaining popularity among tech firms. In addition to Meta, Salesforce Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. have also initiated dividends in recent months. Among the six biggest US technology companies by market value, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc. are the only ones that don’t have a quarterly payout.Alphabet shares are up 10% this year, outperforming Microsoft Corp., as well as the Nasdaq 100. Rising optimism about its generative AI strategy has supported the stock of late, though it fell to a three-month low in March in the wake of a disappointing earnings report and fears that artificial intelligence tools could challenge its dominance in search advertising.With Alphabet’s revenue expected to rise 14% this year and cost cutting efforts supporting profitability, the company’s free cash flow is projected to hit a record $83 billion in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Google parent also had more than $110 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023.“We think Alphabet is likely to follow Meta’s lead by introducing dividends this year,” said Tejas Dessai, research analyst at Global X ETFs. “Given the favorable advertising market and recent cost-saving measures, now seems opportune for such a move, which has generally been positively received by investors.”Of course, Alphabet faces other demands for its cash, such as adding AI computing capacity. The company had a record $32 billion in capital expenditures last year and that spending is expected to jump another 27% in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, the feeling on Wall Street is that Alphabet has plenty of cash for infrastructure spending as well as bigger capital returns.Rather than seeing dividend initiations as a sign that the companies have fewer investment opportunities, market professionals are now viewing it as a sign of strength.“For corporations, sitting on cash in this environment is still suboptimal” said Jenny Harrington, chief executive officer at Gilman Hill Asset Management. “Even if they’re getting 5% on cash, the credit they get for returning cash to shareholders through dividends, or the bump they get from buybacks, mean that those are better capital allocation decisions.”Tech Chart of the DayNvidia Corp shares plummeted 10% on Friday, their biggest one-day drop since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, and the stock closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. The slump erased nearly $212 billion off its market capitalization. The move came amid widespread tech selling, with AI companies seeing some of the most pronounced weakness. Shares edged higher on Monday, rising 2.8%.Top Tech StoriesAfter years of working to assure the US government that its popular social media app isn’t a threat to national security, TikTok’s loss in that fight now seems almost inevitable.Australia is gearing up for a showdown with Elon Musk and US social media giants over allegations they failed to move fast enough to police graphic content and misinformation during two violent attacks in Sydney over the past 10 days.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. options traders are contending with a rising wave of bearishness following the chipmaker’s cautious guidance and concerns about whether the artificial-intelligence trade is unwinding.Apple has long relied on China and the iPhone for growth.

2024-04-19 18:33:00,"Kevin O'Leary Says Working For Steve Jobs Was Brutal — 'He Was Not a Nice Guy,' But O'Leary Still Admires Him Anyway","""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O'Leary recalled working for Apple Inc. Co-Founder Steve Jobs during a recent interview posted on LinkedIn. While most remember Jobs for building the technology and innovation giant now a part of most Americans' everyday lives, O'Leary said he remembers him for a different reason.O'Leary made most of his money when he sold The Learning Company to Mattel for $4.2 billion in 1999. But one of O'Leary's business partners in the runup to that acquisition was Apple.""We, The Learning Company, were his largest provider for educational software when [Apple] wanted to get into schools with the Mac,"" O'Leary said. This meant O'Leary and Jobs regularly met to make that happen.Don't Miss:Invest like a millionaire.

The memoir, titled ""Small Fry"" by Lisa Brennan-Jobs detailed callous and potentially abusive scenarios like refusing to pay child support, refusing to install heat in her bedroom and telling her she will get no inheritance.O'Leary questioned whether the success Jobs saw in his early career would work today.

2024-04-19 18:10:00,"Forget Dividends, Buy These 3 Buyback Behemoths Instead","Buybacks are another way to return cash to shareholders besides dividends. In recent years, buybacks have increased in popularity, exceeding dividends due to their flexibility. Investors are increasingly seeking buyback stocks that return excess cash.Although S&P 500 buybacks declined in 2023, companies continued to favor buybacks over dividends. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, buybacks declined from $922.7 billion in 2022 to $795.2 billion but surpassed dividends of $588.2 billion.For companies generating plenty of free cash flow, buybacks might be the best use of cash. They offer flexibility to the company and some tax advantages to investors. What’s more, if done below intrinsic value, buybacks create long-term value for shareholders.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese three extremely profitable businesses have spent lots of free cash flow on buybacks in recent years. Each has shrunk its share count by more than 30% since 2014. Today, they are top buyback stocks that continue to use repurchases to shrink share count, thereby boosting EPS and value per share.Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comThis auto parts retailer has been one of the top buyback stocks due to its commitment to share buybacks. Since 2014, it has reduced its outstanding shares by 48%. Moreover, it was among the top repurchasers of 2023, buying back shares worth $3.6 billion and reducing its share count by 6.3%.The stable demand for auto parts supports AutoZone’s (NYSE:AZO) free cash flow generation through all economic cycles. When consumers face tight budgets, they keep their old vehicles for longer which adds to repairs. On the other hand, during good times, people drive more. This means their cars frequently need more repairs due to wear and tear.These cycle-agnostic characteristics explain why auto parts retailers have been some of the best compounders. Notably, alongside peer O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), AutoZone achieved same-store sales growth in 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis. Another tailwind has been the consolidation of the fragmented auto parts retail industry as more independent shops close, ceding share to larger chains.AutoZone continues to exhibit positive same-store sales growth. In Q2 fiscal year 2024, it reported total same-store sales growth of 1.8%, achieving 4.9% sales growth. So far, it has repurchased $1.7 billion in FY2024. Given its buyback history, expect more returns of excess cash.Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comIf you are a do-it-yourself enthusiast, you must be familiar with Home Depot (NYSE:HD). It is the leading home improvement retailer in the U.S. by sales. The retailer has benefited from a red-hot housing market over the past decade, particularly from the splurge on home improvement projects during the pandemic.Home Depot’s revenues are evenly split between professional contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. Its focus on the home remodel market has been a growth tailwind, with revenues growing from $83 billion in FY2014 to $152 billion in FY2023. Meanwhile, net income surged from $6.3 billion to $15.1 billion.Leveraging this surge in profitability, Home Depot has been repurchasing its shares at a fast clip. Although revenues declined in 2023 after the pandemic remodeling boom decelerated, it returned $8 billion in repurchases in FY2023. And management still expects to return excess cash to shareholders, making it one of the top buyback stocks.Over the long term, Home Depot will profit from an aging housing stock. This will spur more renovations and repairs, boosting demand for the building products and equipment it sells. Moreover, remodel demand will remain elevated, with homeowners having locked in record low mortgage rates and rising home equity.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comIn 2012, CEO Tim Cook called Warren Buffet asking for advice on what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) should do with its increasing cash hoard. As Cook stated in this CNBC interview, Buffet was straightforward.“Let me just cut through it. If you believe your stock is undervalued, you should buy your stock,” said Buffet.Ever since, Apple has had the largest repurchase program ever, spending $658 billion over the last ten years.It’s worth noting that Apple is one of the most profitable companies on the planet. Its iPhone and iMac products and other accessories have a cult-like following. Furthermore, it has built a high-margin services business around these hardware products. As a result, Apple generates more free cash flow than it knows what to do with.In FY2023, the company reported total revenues of $383 billion and net income of 96.9 billion. Additionally, it generated free cash flow of $82 billion using $76.6 billion to buy back its common stock. Repurchase activity continued in Q1 FY2024, with the company buying back 118 million Apple shares worth $20.5 billion.Apple will update its buyback plans in the upcoming earnings report and another substantial repurchase is likely. Although the stock is facing China-related revenue headwinds, an upgrade cycle triggered by an AI iPhone could be the next catalyst. For now, it’s one of the best buyback stocks, with repurchases supporting AAPL stock price.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-04-19 15:45:00,‘Perfect landing spot.’ Apple plans to spend more in Vietnam as it looks beyond China,"Apple is planning to buy more components from Vietnam, underscoring a trend among global tech firms to look beyond China to secure their supply chains, cut costs and open up new markets.CEO Tim Cook made the pledge in a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi Tuesday, according to a statement by Vietnam’s government.Apple (AAPL) has already spent almost $16 billion through its supply chain in the country since 2019, the government quoted Cook as saying. And the company has created more than 200,000 jobs in Vietnam, it added.According to the statement, Cook said Apple “stands ready … to enhance cooperation and investment activities” in the Southeast Asian country.His visit highlights Vietnam’s growing importance to global companies looking for alternatives to China as trade tensions between Beijing and the West have escalated in recent years.Vietnam has been a “major beneficiary” of moves by multinational companies to diversify their manufacturing hubs — a strategy known as “China plus one” — says Thuy Anh Nguyen, a strategist at Dragon Capital, a local fund management firm that invests solely in Vietnamese companies.Nguyen, whose firm manages $6 billion in assets, told CNN that labor costs in Vietnam’s manufacturing sector are about half those in neighboring China.That has helped Vietnam go from producing mostly “low-value products” like textiles to more tech products like iPhones and iPads, she said. “Those are higher-value items. That’s how we move up the value chain.”Vietnam pulled in more than $4.29 billion in foreign direct investment during the first two months of the year, up almost 39% from the same period in 2023, according to the country’s Ministry of Planning and Investment. Most of the new investment went into the processing and manufacturing sector.In recent years, fast-growing Asian economies like Vietnam and India have emerged as alternative locations for manufacturers as ties between Beijing and the West have frayed.Vietnam is “the perfect landing spot for tech companies to diversify outside China,” according to Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, who pointed to the high number of trained engineers in the country as one factor.“We’re not just talking about (manufacturing of) low-cost electronics,” he told CNN. “We’re talking higher up the value chain… That was not even on the radar (of foreign companies) two years ago.”Once enemies in war, the United States and Vietnam have grown increasingly close — the value of US imports of Vietnamese goods s oared more than 360% in the decade to end-2023 to top $144 billion, according to US government data.In September, the two countries formally upgraded their diplomatic ties to a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” a symbolic yet highly important move that positions Vietnam as a destination for more US investment, including for critical technologies like semiconductor chips.Intel (INTC) has also taken note of Vietnam’s rise. In 2021, the company committed $1.5 billion to a sprawling campus just outside Ho Chi Minh City, which it says will be its largest single assembly and test facility in the world.At the same time, relations between the United States and China have deteriorated. A trade war between the two countries, which began in 2018 when Washington slapped tariffs on many Chinese imports, ratcheted up last year as both sides introduced tit-for-tat chipmaking export controls.During the pandemic, meanwhile, China’s strict zero-Covid policy scrambled global supply chains, demonstrating the risks of concentrating production in a single location.Notably, the world’s biggest iPhone factory, located in central China and owned by Taiwanese manufacturing firm Foxconn, was forced to temporarily shut down in 2022 after workers revolted over fears of the spread of coronavirus.Vietnam has another advantage, says Nguyen: A booming, educated, and youthful population. That’s a big draw for foreign tech companies looking to hire workers for their factories, and find consumers for their products.“Vietnam has a population of 100 million people. If it was in Europe, it would be the biggest country,” she said, also noting that smartphone adoption in Vietnam was rapidly increasing.The International Monetary Fund expects Vietnam’s economy to growth 5.8% this year, much faster than the predicted global average of 3.2%. For 2025, the fund forecasts growth of 6.5% in Vietnam. That’s not far off India’s pace of expansion.Still, Vietnam represents a far smaller market than India, which has also been wooing large foreign companies, including Tesla (TSLA), to set up factories in the country.For now, Vietnam’s attractiveness to foreign firms is “more around supply than demand,” says Ives at Wedbush Securities, while, for India, it encompasses both.Juliana Liu contributed reporting.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perfect-landing-spot-apple-plans-154529075.html,AAPL,0.081,0.032,0.887,0.9829,Positive,167.83999633789062,165.02999877929688,-1.6742121186279961,-1
2024-04-19 15:43:00,"Apple Stock Is ""Dead Money,"" According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock is in a funk. Late to the artificial intelligence game, Apple recently had to iPhone Google for assistance. The latest data on iPhone sales is disheartening -- shipments are down 37% year to date in China. With so much bad news, it's no surprise that Apple stock has lost more than $20 of its value since late January. And now here comes the worst news: Apple's stock price may not recover anytime soon.In fact, according to Maxim Group analyst Tom Forte, Apple stock could be ""dead money"" for a ""prolonged"" period.Now it's worth pointing out: Even Forte isn't saying Apple stock is a sell -- he just doesn't think it's going to go up much anytime soon, setting a $178 price target over the next year, and so rates Apple hold.And why does he think that? As StreetInsider reports, Apple gets 18.9% of its revenue from China -- where its iPhone sales are cratering under government pressure to stop using the devices. And seeing as iPhone accounts for the majority of Apple's operating profit, that's a big drag on growth at Apple. While the company has had some success growing services revenue, the drag on hardware sales, as well as increased regulatory scrutiny of monopolies around the globe, could prevent Apple from growing its sales -- or its stock price -- much at all over the near term.Or the long term, either.Consider that most analysts see Apple's profits growing at only about 10% annually over the next five years. That's not a bad growth rate, exactly. But on a stock that costs more than 26 times earnings, it may not be fast enough to sustain the stock price. For a high-quality, high-profit-margin company like Apple, you might not expect to ever see a PEG ratio of exactly 1 -- but unless Apple can find a way to revive iPhone sales, a 2.5 PEG is probably too much to pay for Apple's stock.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-19 14:55:00,Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy.Jim Cramer said during his program on April 17 that we would need to see at least two months of ""cooling numbers"" before the Fed even considers to start cutting interest rates. He said many investors have been ""clinging"" to rate cut hopes but the economic activity, jobs market, M&A and IPO activity remains hot, giving the Fed no impetus to ease its monetary policy.Cramer lamented that the market is ""ignoring"" the positives and instead continues to react to weak earnings reports posted by some companies including JB Hunt and Prologis.  Jim Cramer added that while he would ""never ever fight"" his viewers who want to sell their stocks right now amid the current market pullback and declines, selling stocks when they are low is not his ""style.""Cramer said that some ""big picture negatives"" were also weighing the market down. The CNBC host said long-term interest rates were rising, commodity and oil prices were soaring before seeing a decline recently amid hopes that Israel won't react to Iran's missile attacks. However, Cramer said these ""green shoots"" are crushed by the bear quickly, leaving no room for positivity.Jim Cramer said that this is a ""market that wants to go down"" and since major stocks like Apple and Tesla are no longer giving a push to the broader market like they did in the recent past, people might think it would make sense to sell out. But Cramer questioned the temptation to immediately sell out of the current market, saying it's never a good idea to sell everything at once.Jim Cramer revealed that his charitable trust kept selling stocks ""every day in the last four weeks."" But Cramer said he didn’t sell his stocks on a decline. Instead, his charitable trust used a strategy called ""scaling out.""""As the stock went higher we sold some shares to raise some cash. If it ever comes back down we can always use that cash to scale back in.""Cramer said he thinks the market is seeing a ""short-term peak"" because the Fed might have ""jumped the gun"" even after indicating earlier in the year that there won't be any need for more rate hikes.Cramer Said He'd Keep Buying Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Cramer sounded agitated on Abbot's pullback despite posting a quarter that according to Cramer was ""terrific."" Cramer said when he saw Abbot's stock getting ""annihilated"" despite strong numbers, he knew that the market has gone ""too negative."" Cramer said he bought more Abbot shares on the latest decline. ABT is one of the stocks Cramer is recommending in April.MethodologyFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment of stocks? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Some top stocks both hedge funds and Cramer love include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 8Jim Cramer said during his program on April 4 that he likes HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK). Cramer said he had recommended the stock before and it “shot up” before coming down. Cramer said he’s surprised to see the stock price of HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK) so low given the skyrocketing oil price.“I want you to buy High Peak, right here!” Cramer said.Wasatch Micro Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“We also added HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK), an exploration & production (E&P) company that performs geological and geophysical services, petroleum engineering and drilling. HighPeak is focused on developing unconventional oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the Midland Basin of Texas. We like that the company’s energy reserves contain fewer byproducts than typically found in the reserves of competitors. Prior to our purchase, the stock was down because HighPeak had taken on too much debt. Under the leadership of Jack Hightower, the new chairman and CEO, the company has raised equity—largely from the management team—and has refinanced the debt. Going forward, we think HighPeak is attractive as an independent company or as an acquisition target of a larger competitor. Our confidence in HighPeak is enhanced by Mr. Hightower’s track record of success in the E&P industry and his willingness to put his own money where his mouth is.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 17Jim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts about Texas-based Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM). He said Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM) is a “good stock” and praised the company’s dividend yield. Cramer also said that Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM) has got mineral rights which make it a suitable play in the current environment since according to Cramer we are in an “inflationary environment” when it comes to oil and minerals.“I think you’ve got a good one,” Cramer said.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 17 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM).Viper talked about guidance and other important updates during its earnings call in February:""Our GRP acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter, clearly laid out the framework that we look for in large-scale M&A. First, it must be accretive on all relevant financial measures. Second, there must be high-quality, undeveloped inventory that supports our long-term growth profile and provides clear visibility to future development. And third, the acquisition must provide significant scale that results in a pro forma business that is both bigger and better. Separately, Viper also completed its conversion into a Delaware corporation during the fourth quarter. We believe this conversion has delivered increased governance rights for our shareholders and positions Viper to grow our business and fully highlight the advantaged nature of mineral and royalty ownership.Looking ahead to 2024, we’ve initiated production guidance for both Q1 and the full year. While Q1 is expected to the weakest quarter of the year, primarily as a result of the timing of large pads, we continue to see strong activity levels across our acreage position and expect significant growth to occur throughout the year with 20 — with Q4 2024 production expected to be at or above the high end of our guidance range. This continued production growth, along with our best-in-class cost structure, should enable Viper to continue to return a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders primarily through our base plus variable dividend.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 19Jim Cramer called CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) a “very strong stock” in a latest program on CNBC. He said “I love this” stock and recommended existing CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) investors to “stay long.” For those who don’t own the restaurant chain company stock, Cramer’s advice is to “consider” the stock.In addition to CAVA, Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 29Earlier in April, Jim Cramer called Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  a “horrendous” stock but said that it’s “about to go up.” Cramer said while input costs in the chicken industry are doing down, we are “about to have a chicken price explosion.”When asked why doesn’t he like Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) when its margins are going up, Cramer reiterated that he’s actually recommending people to buy the stock; he just wants Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  to lower chicken prices.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 29 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) .Citing expected profits from chicken and pork segment, Citi recently hiked its price target for Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  to $62.Jim Cramer also recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) for long term.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 33Solar energy tracking and optimization solutions company Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) is one of the latest stock recommendations of Jim Cramer. A questioner asked Cramer about a recent analyst downgrade for Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT). Cramer said that he “read that downgrade” and believes it was just “someone trying to create a little noise.”Jim Cramer thinks Nextracker Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NXT) “story” is good and said he’d be a buyer of the stock “right here at $52”. Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) shares have pulled back since and as of April 15 morning the stock was trading at around $47. Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy. Suggested Articles:Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other StocksJim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in AprilJim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 StocksDisclosure.

Now, with nonfarm payrolls coming in hotter than anticipated, it may not be impossible for a policy pivot to occur.Still, one alternative proposal is that the central bank may take a modest approach to financial engineering. If so, the robust labor market – while carrying inflationary implications – offers one significant positive: more people have more money to spend. And that extra cash will almost certainly work its way into the economy.Even with the challenges that we have, Americans continue to spend. Indeed, we’re spending money we don’t have, with credit card debt skyrocketing to $1.13 trillion. Yet the machine keeps marching onward. If you believe that the music won’t stop, below are the stocks for a hot job market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comIn my opinion, the bullish case for HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) sells itself. An independent energy company, HF Sinclair produces and markets gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and many other petroleum-based products. Thus, it’s a downstream operator, meaning that it focuses on the marketing and refining end of the hydrocarbon value chain. Stated differently, if it goes in your car, it’s downstream.One of the cynical factors that make DINO a compelling idea for stocks for a hot job market is the broader economic backdrop. Yes, electric vehicles are becoming more commonplace. However, the vast majority of people drive combustion-powered vehicles. Further, when discussing new energy vehicles, it’s hybrids that have dominated the discourse. Guess what? Hybrids need gasoline.With more people having jobs, workers make enough to afford the rising prices of gasoline. However, they’re not making so much that they can make the jump to EVs. Therefore, DINO’s assessment as a moderate buy is quite reasonable. Wall Street’s experts believe shares can rise to $66, with the high-side target hitting $78.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGiven the recent volatility in used-car dealership Carmax (NYSE:KMX), KMX seems an unusually risky idea for stocks for a hot job market. Indeed, management didn’t offer an encouraging outlook during its most recent earnings call. Further, inflation remains hot (naturally) and borrowing costs are also elevated. This dynamic is hampering demand for big-ticket items.However, the reality is that vehicles – whether they be combustion powered or otherwise – are mechanical products. Mechanical products eventually wear down or in the case of EVs don’t hold their charge. Now, in certain parts of the country (mainly in the east coast), you can get away without having a personal vehicle.Try that in California or anywhere else. You’re just not going to get that far. And so, we come across a harsh reality: used cars may be an inevitability.Sure, the latest projections for the current fiscal year call for earnings per share of $3.41 on sales of $26.64 billion. That implies very modest growth on the top line. However, because of the necessity of personal transportation, the high-side metrics of $4.10 EPS on revenue of $28.58 billion isn’t out of the question.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comOne of the challenges associated with consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is commoditization. When the company launched its first iPhone, it truly revolutionized the world. It singlehandedly pioneered an entirely new product category. Then came other smart devices, which have done the company so well. However, these devices are no longer special and cheaper copycats have sprouted everywhere.That said, what I appreciate about the “fruit” brand is that it commands social cachet. It’s not just about the devices but the underlying Apple ecosystem. Therefore, with the unemployment rate coming in lower than expected, people may be incentivized to boost their discretionary spending. If so, I can see Apple leveraging this social cachet to its advantage.For the current fiscal year, analysts are seeking EPS of $6.55, a noticeable bump up from last year’s print of $6.13. Now, the top line is much more modest, with projected sales of $386.51 billion less than 1% up from fiscal 2023’s result. However, fiscal 2025 could see sales jump to nearly $412 billion. Thus, AAPL could rank among the stocks for a hot job market.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comA company that needs no introduction, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represents one of the top stocks for a hot job market. Fundamentally, the company pioneered the e-commerce revolution. What’s remarkable is that post-pandemic, consumers have gravitated toward online transactions. Significantly, e-commerce transactions as a percentage of total retail sales have been steadily rising since the second quarter of 2022.Back during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis (Q2 2020), this metric soared to a record 16.5%. It will be difficult to match that level of scope and scale. Yet we’re close, with e-commerce transactions coming in at 15.6% of total sales in Q4 2023. Conspicuously, this rise occurred during a period of rising inflation and rising interest rates.It’s possible that consumers may have acclimated to the inflationary paradigm. If so, AMZN could be a compelling idea for stocks for a hot job market. With the unemployment rate so low, people could resume their obsession with online transactions.Presently, experts rate AMZN a unanimous strong buy with a $212.21 average price target. It’s a reasonable assessment given the underlying relevance.Source: monticello / Shutterstock.comBased on broader economic challenges, I’ve been skeptical about the prospects for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Yes, it’s pretty much the reason for existence among suburban America. It may be responsible for maintaining the mental health of white-collar office workers. Yet its caffeinated products are heavily overpriced. You know what I’m talking about if you go to one.Still, a combination of a robust labor market and broader normalization trends (i.e. return to office) could inspire the need for psychological rewards. People need their caffeine to lift their spirits and admittedly, Starbucks’ products feature an addictive nature. Your brain fills with endorphins the moment you walk in. That’s probably by design.Covering experts believe the company’s EPS will land at $4.04 in fiscal 2024. That’s a big improvement over last year’s print of $3.54. Also, sales could clock in at $38.75 billion, up 7.7% from 2023’s tally of $35.98 billion.What’s notable is that in fiscal 2025, analysts are seeking revenue of $42.46 billion, up 10% from projected 2024 sales. So, it could be one of the stocks for a hot job market.Source: ShutterstockAn intriguing but risky idea for stocks for a hot job market, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) could potentially benefit from the increase in discretionary funds. To be clear, it’s not an argument without downside concerns. With so many Americans deeply indebted, one of the easiest budget items to cut is entertainment.That said, an increase in the employment rate suggests that people will be looking to blow off some steam during happy hours or the weekends. From that angle, DRI stock could make sense. Also, it’s important to consider Darden’s acquisition of premium steakhouse Ruth’s Chris. This buyout could help Darden target the higher-income crowd, who may be looking for distinct experiences.Analysts are overall bullish on DRI stock, pegging it a consensus strong buy. Further, for the current fiscal year, they’re anticipating EPS of $8.85, a big improvement over last year’s print of $7.99. As for the top line, the experts are targeting sales of $11.41 billion, up almost 9% from the prior year.Source: shutterstock.com/zimmytwsAlthough the labor market is booming, not everyone will win out. That’s just economic reality. On a related point, not everyone will be satisfied with their income. I’d venture to say that with the inflationary pressures, most people are dissatisfied with their compensation. And that’s where Universal Technical Institute (NYSE:UTI) comes into play. Basically, the company provides real skills that are in high demand.The company provides vocational education geared toward the transportation or mobility space. What’s really intriguing here is the fading demand for plug-in electric-powered vehicles. Stated differently, combustion-based platforms should enjoy extended relevancy. That means the addressable market for mechanics may be larger than previously anticipated.For the current fiscal year, covering experts are seeking EPS of 70 cents. That’s a huge leap up from last year’s result of 13 cents EPS. Also, revenue is expected to land at $716.09 million. That’s up 17.9% from 2023’s haul of $607.41 million.Finally, analysts rate UTI a unanimous strong buy with a $17.60 price target. It’s one of the stocks for a hot job market.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

2024-04-19 14:00:00,How a DCF Analysis Supports the Bull Case for Apple,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has not been receiving quite as much love from investors as it usually does. The stock is down 9% so far in 2024 against the S&P 500's (SPY) 7% gains through mid-April.Some of the recent bearishness toward the Cupertino, California-based tech company is founded on short-term concerns. For instance, iPhone sales in the important China market seemed to be under pressure at the start of the year. Others worry more about the core of Apple's business. For example, the company's ecosystem remains under the scrutiny of regulatory agencies around the world. In addition, some fear that Apple may have missed the boat on artificial intelligence.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TJX.The bulls, however, may have good reason to cheer the recent pullback as an opportunity to buy the stock at more attractive levels. A discounted cash flow analysis may help to put numbers around the optimism.To the benefit of those unfamiliar, DCF is an intrinsic valuation methodology in which future free cash flows produced by a company can be discounted to present value to arrive at a fair value of the stock. Because Apple runs two interdependent but largely dissimilar business segments, namely products and services, I like to think of the stock's value as two separate pieces.Products is a segment that includes primarily the iPhone, representing roughly half of Apple's total revenues, but also the Mac, iPad as well as wearable and home devices. The products segment featured relatively low margins of 37% in fiscal 2023 compared to the services segment's nearly 71%.In isolation, products is an inferior business to services not only because of the lower margins, but also because of less predictability around future revenue, earnings and cash flow. Still, I think is it reasonable to expect Apple's product sales to rise by an average of 5% per year through the next five years, albeit not without year-to-year ebbs and flows.The segment would benefit from the iPhone's competitive advantages and brand loyalty, and the full-scale launch of mixed-reality devices. I see this growth rate declining to 3.50% for the next five years before normalizing at a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.Regarding profitability, I think it is prudent to assume that Ebit margins will level out, despite them having risen lately due to a heavier mix of pricier devices like the iPhone Pro and Pro Max and the margin gains driven by Apple's M-family of chips. On working capital, I also conservatively assume that the company will not produce any additional cash flow, despite having done so in the past several years through tight inventory and payables management.Lastly, I think it is reasonable to discount Apple's future product cash flows at a rate of 12.50%. While this rate seems too high for the company at large, it better reflects the lower growth and higher risk profile of the device business. Using the assumptions above, I estimate the fair value of Apple's product segment is roughly $1.14 trillion.In my view, the majority of the market value created by Apple comes from the relatively smaller services business. This segment, which represented only 22% of total revenue in fiscal 2023, is much more profitable and produces cash flows more predictably.On the first point, services like the App Store and Apple TV+ tend to be highly scalable. While either may generate substantial costs to operate, each marginal dollar in revenue tends to flow straight to operating income, as it produces relatively little in marginal costs. On the latter point, much of Apple's service revenues are either derived from subscriptions or locked in by contract (think about Apple Care as an example). It is no wonder that service revenues have been remarkably stable over time, as the chart below depicts.For the next five years, I assume services will grow sales at an annual rate of 12%, which is consistent with recent history, although conservative relative to how fast service revenue used to grow before last year. On Ebit margins, I assume an expansion of 100 basis points per year through 2028 due to the scale factor mentioned above. I think free cash flow growth then slows down from an average of 12% per year between 2023 and 2028 to 8% between 2029 and 2033, before settling at a much lower perpetuity growth rate of 2% beyond the next decade.The discount rate used for services should logically be much lower than that used for Apple's products business. This is the case because of the higher margins, better scalability and lower volatility of future cash flows, as mentioned above. Therefore, I think a discount rate of 7.50% for the services segment, which is three percentage points higher than the 10-year treasury yield, is appropriate.Using the assumptions above, I arrive at a fair value of $1.93 trillion for the services segment. Added to products' $1.14 trillion and $51 billion in net cash, Apple stock should then be worth roughly $3.10 trillion or $200 per share, which represents 14% of upside potential to the current price.Of course, a DCF analysis is only as good as the assumptions that go into it. For instance, I could project that services will grow at 3% per year in perpetuity beyond 2033, and that would give me a fair value on Apple shares of $217.50 for 24% upside potential. Instead, if I assume the discount rate applied to the services business should be 10% instead of 7.50%, then Apple shares would be worth only about $160 for a 10% downside potential.The more important point, however, is this year's 9% decline in Apple stock price and 11% pullback since the December 2023 all-time high provides investors with a wider margin of error. Assuming I am right about Apple shares being worth $200, having bought them a mere four months ago would have been a bad move. Buying now instead could produce decent double-digit gains, which I believe will materialize in the next 12 months.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dcf-analysis-supports-bull-case-140002114.html,AAPL,0.142,0.043,0.815,0.9986,Positive,167.72000122070312,165.41160583496094,-1.3763387603989847,-1
2024-04-18 15:54:00,‘Meta is out of options’: EU regulators reject its privacy fee for Facebook and Instagram,"It looks like Meta’s strategy of charging European Facebook and Instagram users, for the privilege of not being tracked for ad-targeting purposes, ain’t gonna fly.Meta introduced the subscriptions late last year in an attempt to grapple with the implications of a bombshell July ruling by the EU’s highest court, which found that Meta had no legal basis for tracking its users across its services and third-party sites unless it got their express consent to do so. But privacy advocates swiftly complained, arguing that it’s not real consent if the only alternative is shelling out yet another monthly subscription fee—originally as much as €12.99 ($13.82) for an account used on both mobile and the web, before Meta last month proposed a drop to €5.99 as a way of mollifying its critics.Today, Politico first reported that the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)—the umbrella organization for the EU’s various privacy regulators—had decided that the privacy advocates complaining about what they derisively called Meta’s “pay or okay” model had a point.“In most cases, it will not be possible for large online platforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent if they confront users only with a binary choice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioral advertising purposes and paying a fee,” the EDPB said in its opinion, published later in the day.EDPB Chair Anu Talus said platforms “should give users a real choice when employing ‘consent or pay’ models,” adding: “The models we have today usually require individuals to either give away all their data or to pay. As a result most users consent to the processing in order to use a service, and they do not understand the full implications of their choices.”“Overall, Meta is out of options in the EU,” said Max Schrems, the Austrian activist lawyer whose 13-year legal crusade against Meta is what gradually removed those options, in a statement. “It must now give users a genuine yes/no option for personalized advertising. It can still charge pages for reach, engage in contextual ads and alike—but tracking people for ads needs a clear ‘yes’ by users.”Meta has tried using various legal justifications for scooping up and processing European users’ personal data over the years since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018—with each being successively shot down by regulators as being an unacceptable reading of the privacy law. First Meta claimed that this tracking was part of its user contract, then that it had a “legitimate interest” in conducting targeted advertising, and now that it’s getting genuine consent from those who choose to avoid the new fees.Schrems claimed that the introduction of subscription fees as the alternative increased the proportion of people agreeing to be tracked from 3% to over 90%. “You don’t need a lawyer to see that it’s not ‘freely given’ consent,” he said. “In fact, five years after the GDPR came into force, this is just the latest ‘trick’ to undermine EU law or at least delay compliance for a few more years.”Meta did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.In other European regulatory news, Apple’s latest beta version of iOS makes it possible for EU iPhone users to directly download apps from developers’ websites, rather than having to use an app store. Originally reported by MacRumors, that is part of Apple’s tortuous journey toward compliance with the new Digital Markets Act, a blockbuster antitrust law. There are conditions, though, including Apple’s insistence that apps can only be eligible if they’ve already had at least a million first installs on iOS in the EU, in the previous year.Meanwhile, the European Commission is miffed that TikTok launched a new “TikTok Lite” app in France and Spain before conducting a legally required risk assessment about its potential impact on young people’s mental health, in particular “potential stimulation of addictive behavior,” Reuters reports. The app, which is supposed to be for over-18s, rewards its use with points that can be exchanged for Amazon vouchers and the like. TikTok—which the Commission is already formally investigating under the new online-content law known as the Digital Services Act—now has all of one day to submit that risk assessment.

2024-04-18 15:45:00,"Apple will soon let users in the EU download apps through web sites, not just the App Store","Apple is opening up web distribution for iOS apps targeting users in the European Union starting Tuesday. Developers who opt in — and who meet Apple's criteria, including app notarization requirements — will be able to offer iPhone apps for direct download to EU users from their own websites.It's a massive change for a mobile ecosystem that otherwise bars so-called ""sideloading."" Apple's walled garden stance has enabled it to funnel essentially all iOS developer revenue through its own App Store in the past. But, in the EU, that moat is being dismantled as a result of new regulations that apply to the App Store and which the iPhone maker has been expected to comply with since early last month.In March, Apple announced that a web distribution entitlement would soon be coming to its mobile platform as part of changes aimed at complying with the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA). The pan-EU regulation puts a set of obligations on in-scope tech giants that lawmakers hope will level the competitive playing field for platforms' business users, as well as protecting consumers from Big Tech throwing its weight around.Briefing journalists on the latest development to its EU app ecosystem Tuesday, ahead of the official announcement, an Apple representative said developers wanting to distribute iOS apps directly will be able to tap into the entitlement through beta 2 of iOS 17.5.In order to do so developers will have to opt into Apple's new EU business terms, which include a new ""core technology fee"" charged at €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months regardless of where apps are distributed. App makers wishing to avoid the fee currently have no choice but to remain on Apple's old business terms, meaning they are unable to access any of the DMA entitlements.In earlier DMA changes, App has opened up to allow marketplace apps in the EU where developers can run their own app stores on iOS, including marketplaces composed of only their own apps.Additional DMA-driven reforms include more flexibility from Apple around in-app payments, as well as a ban on its usual anti-steering measures. This means that iOS developers opting into the new T&Cs can inform their users of cheaper offers available outside Apple's own App Store.Returning to the new option of web distribution for iOS apps, Apple's criteria for developers wanting to distribute their software directly include that they be in good standing with its developer program; attest to handle things like IP disputes and government takedown requests; and commit to providing iOS users with customer service, as Apple will not offer that kind of support for iOS apps downloaded outside its App Store.Europe’s DMA rules for Big Tech explainedIt also emphasizes that all apps distributed from the web must meet its notarizations requirements, which it says are intended to protect platform integrity.An Apple rep described this as a baseline safety and security standard, which they said iOS users expect to help ensure their device is protected from external risks.The company continues to argue that sideloading apps carries inherent security risks for mobile users, suggesting it's trying to find a way to comply with the DMA while taking steps to limit risks the changes create for its users.The first time an iOS user attempts to download an app from a developer's website they will be required to authorize the developer to install apps directly on their device. Apple's current design of the authorization flow involves multiple steps and requires users to verify that they wish to provide permission for developer via the iOS settings menu and by clicking ""allow"" on subsequent permission pop-ups (the other option, i.e. to deny permission, reads ""ignore"").After they have gone through this multi-step flow and approved a developer, any future direct downloads involve fewer steps, per Apple.The design of the follow-on flow that Apple showed during the briefing includes a screen notifying users that ""updates and purchases in this app will be managed by the developer,"" combined with a suggestion they ""verify the information below before installing,"" which is displayed above a card showing some basic app info and screenshots, as well as a link to see ""more"" info.Apple argues these steps and the information iOS surfaces to users during the authorization process for direct web downloads are reasonable security measures; the DMA permits gatekeepers to apply these steps in order to protect platform integrity.However critics of Apple's DMA approach have decried these sort of pop-ups as ""scare screens,"" arguing the flow it designs is intended to inject friction and dissuade iOS users from stepping outside Apple's garden — such as by implying direct downloads are riskier than downloads through Apple's own App Store.Apple's approach to a number of other elements of DMA compliance are under investigation by the European Commission, so at least some of these criticisms have spurred EU enforcers to take a closer look at its take on what the law demands.Last month the Commission announced that it's looking into Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the design of choice screens for alternatives to its Safari web browser, which is another regulated core platform service under the DMA. The EU also announced some ""investigatory steps"" in relation to Apple's new iOS fee structure, but, for now, the new core tech fee stands.Given Apple has only just started implementing web distribution for iOS apps, it remains to be seen whether the EU will step in for a closer look at this aspect of its DMA compliance, too.It's also unclear how much demand there will be among iOS developers for direct web distribution. Asked about this, Apple said it's heard from some app makers they want to have the option but it also pointed out it's a new capability, which is just starting to be made available, saying it's unsure how many developers will actually want to take advantage of the option. The option sits alongside the existing (established) and still available option of App Store distribution.In the EU, developers also now have a third route for reaching users: They can submit a marketplace app to Apple requesting to distribute their software through their own alternative store hosted on its platform.Apple to allow web distribution for iOS apps in latest DMA tweaksSpotify, Epic Games and others pen letter to EC, claiming Apple has made a ‘mockery’ of the DMAThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/apple-web-distribution-ios/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-opens-distribution-option-ios-170002467.html,AAPL,0.08,0.047,0.8740000000000001,0.9868,Positive,169.08999633789062,167.83999633789062,-0.7392513023077599,-1
2024-04-18 15:10:00,Opinion: These Will Be the 4 Largest Companies by 2035,"Just 11 years ago, Apple, ExxonMobil, Alphabet, and Berkshire Hathaway were the four largest American companies. Today, only two of those companies -- Apple and Alphabet -- remain in the top four. Berkshire Hathaway has slipped to No. 7, and ExxonMobil and Walmart have fallen from the top 10 altogether.A lot can change in only 11 years. Let's look at the companies I believe will claim the top four spots in 2035.By 2035, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will be the world's largest company by market cap. What's more, I think it could happen even sooner.One reason is that Nvidia has already grown faster than nearly anyone expected. The company's market cap has exploded almost 10x, from $0.3 trillion to $2.2 trillion in less than two years.The massive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is behind the company's rapid rise. Thanks to its leading position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, Nvidia is well-positioned to take the crown as the largest company by 2035 -- if not sooner. That's because the GPU market is expected to grow by leaps and bounds over the next decade. According to Global Markets Insights, the size of the GPU market is set to expand from $40 billion in 2022 to $400 billion by 2032. What's more, the ramp in GPU spending is already here. Nvidia's sales increased by a mind-blowing 265% year over year in its most recent quarter (the three months ending Jan. 28, 2024). While sales are expected to cool somewhat, analysts still expect the company to grow them by 82% this year. Over the next five years, given the explosive growth of the overall GPU market, analysts expect Nvidia's sales to rise 37% per year, meaning the company's annual revenue by 2030 could approach $300 billion.In short, Nvidia is riding a tsunami of growth that could carry it all the way to the top spot by 2035.With a market cap of $3.2 trillion, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is currently the world's largest company, having passed Apple last year.Like Nvidia, the AI revolution has lifted Microsoft's market cap significantly. The company's extensive and iconic software suite offers a natural home for AI-powered tools, and it has wasted no time integrating AI features into its software.What's more, Microsoft enjoys a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. That partnership has already helped both companies and puts Microsoft in a good spot to benefit from future AI breakthroughs that OpenAI may make. AI will likely be the key factor in driving market caps higher over the next decade, and Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on that trend. In terms of growth, analysts expect Microsoft to grow sales by 16% per year over the next five years, implying annual sales of over $475 billion by 2030. That's nearly in line with an internal target set by chief executive officer (CEO) Satya Nadella of $500 billion in revenue by 2030. Either way, Microsoft's expected growth shows that the company has staying power, and while the company may not be able to stay ahead of Nvidia, it will likely keep its lead over everyone else.With a current market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is currently America's fifth-largest company. But by 2035, I see it leapfrogging a number of companies, including Apple and Alphabet, to take the third spot.That's because Amazon, like Nvidia and Microsoft before it, has a natural way to benefit from the AI revolution. The company already utilizes more than 750,000 robots in its sprawling warehouses. They measure and pack products, move heavy items, read labels, and distribute shelves and packages.In addition, AI should help the company improve the digital side of its e-commerce business. AI assistants can shop for customers and help with returns. AI-powered ad tools can refine which customers see which ads, leading to improved return on investment (ROI) and generating more ad revenue for Amazon. Moreover, the company's crown jewel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), should continue to benefit from the transition to the cloud over the next decade.Amazon is already one of the largest companies by revenue; the company has generated $575 billion over the last 12 months -- second only to Walmart's $648 billion. However, Amazon is closing the gap quickly and should overtake Walmart soon. Analysts expect Amazon to grow its revenue by 31% per year over the next five years, bringing annual revenue to an eye-popping $2.2 trillion by 2030.Thanks to its impressive revenue growth, I think Amazon will climb the rankings up to third place.Rounding out the top four is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Currently the sixth-largest American company by market cap, I expect Meta to leapfrog both Alphabet and Apple by 2035.Meta is quickly becoming one of the world's biggest cash cows. The company's lucrative ad business continues to grow by leaps and bounds as the digital advertising market expands. Moreover, Meta's ambitious AI research and development could lead to revolutionary breakthroughs over the next decade. In terms of revenue, analysts expect Meta to grow revenue by 26% annually over the next five years, leading to an annual total of $429 billion by 2030.At any rate, with its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) providing ample free cash flow, Meta is well-positioned to grow its market cap significantly over the next decade, so it could surpass laggards like Alphabet and Apple by 2035.Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-18 14:43:00,Apple fixes iPhone bug that suggested Palestinian flag when some people typed ‘Jerusalem’,"Apple has fixed a bug that suggested the Palestinian flag emoji when some users searched for the word “Jerusalem” in the emoji keyboard.On Tuesday, the company addressed the bug with the latest beta software release of iOS 17.5, just a few days after it said it was working on a fix.Apple’s previous update was introduced on March 21, but the recent discovery of the bug upset some users on social media. In one April 9 post on X viewed more than 2.3 million times, an iPhone user questioned whether Apple was aware of the error – and whether it was intentional. Apple said at the time the issue was a mistake and not coded into the keyboard intentionally.But the user, who said she was Jewish, provided a long list of other cities that don’t surface a flag when entered into the emoji search box. It’s possible, however, Apple’s machine-learning technology determined the suggested emoji based on analyzing texts from millions of its users.The history of the region is complicated, and territorial claims in the ancient city are no less so. In 1967, Israel captured East Jerusalem along with other regions and later annexed that as part of Jerusalem to unify the city as its capital – although much of the international community recognizes East Jerusalem as Israel-occupied Palestinian territory. For its part, Israel considers Jerusalem as its undivided capital. In 2017, the US administration of President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, reversing decades of American foreign policy.So suggesting a Palestinian flag emoji for the search query “Jerusalem,” particularly when Israel is at war with Hamas, added tensions amid a long-running dispute.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-fixes-iphone-bug-suggested-144341095.html,AAPL,0.019,0.077,0.904,-0.9559,Negative,169.94000244140625,168.16000366210938,-1.0474277708161162,-1
2024-04-18 13:53:00,"Got $5,000? These 3 Growth Stocks Are on Sale Right Now","Do you have $5,000 that you're looking to invest in the stock market today? Below are some solid businesses you can invest in and which have promising long-term prospects but whose shares haven't been doing all that well this year. Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) are all in negative territory, and here's why that has created some great buying opportunities for investors.Cash-rich tech giant Apple has a wonderful business. It's Warren Buffett's top investment and for good reason -- it has a strong brand and fantastic financials behind it. Consumer demand for its products has remained relatively resilient even though economic conditions aren't ideal for a business that sells high-priced products.Last quarter, Apple's product revenue was flat at around $96.5 billion for the last three months of 2023. But it's the company's other segment, services, which is what should make investors bullish on the business. Service revenue totaled $23.1 billion and rose 11% year over year. Once Apple has consumers into its ecosystem, it can be hard (i.e., costly) for them to leave.As the business grows its service business, such as potentially launching a chatbot in the future, it has the potential to expand on these opportunities. That means even if its products may not be generating strong growth in the future, they may not need to given the potential for the service segment to pick up the slack.Shares of Apple are down 9% this year, but with the stock trading at a more modest 28 times earnings, now may be a prime time to invest in the business. Its strong 26% profit margins and phenomenal brand make Apple a stock worth adding to your portfolio whenever it's on sale. It can be a great place in which to invest $5,000 today.The worst-performing stock on this list is PDD Holdings -- it's down 21% year to date. The China-based company comes with inherent risks, such as the worry that the Chinese government may add regulations which restrict its growth prospects at home and abroad. That risk is one of the reasons many Chinese stocks aren't the hot buys they might otherwise be.But if you're comfortable with that risk, then PDD could make for a potential bargain buy in the long run. It trades at just 20 times earnings, and that multiple falls to 13 when looking at its future profits and what analysts expect from the business in the year ahead. In the longer run, it looks even cheaper, with a price-to-earnings growth, or PEG ratio, of just 0.6. Normally, a stock that is trading with a PEG of less than one is considered cheap; PDD is arguably a bargain.The company behind the popular Temu online marketplace reported revenue of $34.9 billion last year, growing at a rate of 90%. Its operating profit rose at an even higher rate of 93%, coming in at $8.3 billion. Temu's continued success and popularity make PDD Holdings a great growth stock to buy and hold.Health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group has been facing some bad press of late. A data breach involving its subsidiary Change Healthcare is concerning enough that a federal agency will investigate into the hack. Unfortunately, data breaches aren't uncommon these days. While they are concerning and can be problematic in the short term, they normally don't weigh on a company's long-term prospects.This is an example of a good, modestly growing business that investors can buy and hold for years. In 2023, UnitedHealth reported revenue of $371.6 billion, which rose by 15% year over year. And its operating earnings of $32.4 billion increased by 14%. What I like about UnitedHealth as a long-term buy is its dominance and importance in the health insurance industry. In the years ahead as the number of seniors in the U.S. increases, there will be even more demand for its products and services. It also pays investors a dividend that yields 1.7%, which is higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.4%.Shares of UnitedHealth are down 15% this year. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 18, this modestly priced stock can make for an excellent investment to buy and forget about.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: TD Cowen upgraded e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $190, down from $220. The firm sees the potential for e.l.f. to double its business by fiscal 2027 with shelf space and international expansion as the driving forces.HSBC upgraded Danaher (DHR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $280, up from $250. HSBC's supply chain analysis suggests the de-stocking effects as well as order books might be on a recovery path for the life sciences tools sector.Wells Fargo upgraded Omnicom (OMC) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $106, up from $91. The firm sees upside to the company's organic growth from new business, media trends and ""Flywheel.""Morgan Stanley upgraded Antero Resources (AR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $36, up from $26. The firm sees the company providing attractive leverage to rising gas prices and leading exposure to the growing liquified natural fairway in the Gulf Coast.Guggenheim upgraded Group 1 Automotive (GPI) to Buy from Neutral with a $305 price target, calling it the ""best positioned dealer"" to navigate the current landscape, which is ""somehow trading at [the] lowest multiple.""Top 5 Downgrades:Northcoast downgraded Boeing (BA) to Sell from Neutral with a $140 price target. The firm expects Boeing's quarterly earnings report in two weeks to prompt concerns about the company's underlying fundamentals and ultimately shift investor focus to liquidity and acquisition concerns.JPMorgan downgraded Fortive (FTV) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $90, down from $95. The firm also removed the shares from its Analyst Focus List. The company's Precision Technologies order trends have remained sluggish so far this year, with sales likely down through the first half of 2024 despite support from an excess backlog that is close to being exhausted, JPMorgan says.Jefferies downgraded Urban Outfitters (URBN) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $32, down from $42. The firm's latest data shows a ""notable deceleration"" in rolling three-month foot traffic to all three of Urban's brands.Wells Fargo downgraded EQT Corporation (EQT) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $37, down from $48. The firm acknowledges that the recently announced merger with Equitrans Midstream (ETRN) should position the company as a unique ""Gas E&P + Midstream"" entity, resembling a mini super-major, but says it is clear the E&P and midstream investor communities will take some time to embrace this integrated model, versus the prevailing preference for pure-play narratives.Piper Sandler downgraded Marsh McLennan (MMC) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $211. The shares are now ""reasonably valued"" and there is not much in the way of future catalysts that will change that, the firm says.Top 5 Initiations: Maxim initiated coverage of Amazon.com (AMZN) with a Buy rating and $218 price target. The firm believes the company will be able to exploit consumer internet trends that include advertising, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, healthcare, logistics, and over-the-top, or OTT, video.Maxim initiated coverage of Apple (AAPL) with a Hold rating and $178 price target. Apple is too dependent on China, from a sales and supply-chain standpoint, and it is overweight a single product, the iPhone, when it comes to its near-term operating results, the firm says.Maxim initiated coverage of Beyond (BYND) with a Buy rating and $50 price target. The firm contends that the company will be able to exploit the Consumer Internet trends of 2024 that include international expansion as well as Blockchain and Mobile opportunities.Raymond James initiated coverage of GE Vernova (GEV) with an Outperform rating and $160 price target.  The firm looks at Vernova as a mid-single-digit growth story, with power lagging behind wind and electrification.Mizuho initiated coverage of Royal Caribbean (RCL) with a Buy rating and $164 price target.

2024-04-17 18:16:00,"Apple lawsuit behind it, chip startup Rivos plots its next moves","Rivos made headlines in 2022 after Apple filed a trade secrets suit against it, which accused Rivos of hiring away dozens of Apple engineers and using confidential info to develop chips to rival the iPhone maker's own.The company denied the allegations and countersued Apple for unfair competition. Apple ended up settling its lawsuit in February. Around the same time, it ended separate litigation with several of the Apple engineers Rivos had hired.Now, with the courtroom drama behind it, Rivos is redoubling its efforts to bring its chipset tech to market, CEO Puneet Kumar told TechCrunch.""Rivos was founded with the mission of building industry-leading, power-efficient, high-performance chips,"" Kumar said. ""We're excited to be targeting customers who are building data-driven solutions.""A substantial new funding tranche will help to finance those efforts.On Tuesday, Rivos announced that it raised over $250 million in an oversubscribed, extended Series A led by Matrix Capital Management with participation from chip giants, including Intel (via its corporate VC division) and MediaTek. Other backers included Cambium Capital, Hotung Venture Group, Walden Catalyst, Dell Technologies Capital and Koch Disruptive Technologies.It's quite the turnaround for Rivos, which was founded in 2021 and roughly a year ago was struggling to raise funds from investors and recruit employees under the shadow of the Apple suit. In August, Rivos laid off nearly two dozen employees, or 6% of its workforce at the time, and was forced to delay a planned $400 billion Series A fundraising round, The Information reported at the time.The long-term goal with Rivos, Kumar said, is to build chips primarily for servers that can handle intensive data analytics and AI workloads, including generative AI workloads.""We're targeting customers building data-driven solutions (e.g., those utilizing generative AI and data analytics to drive decisions),"" Kumar said. ""There're many companies targeting such markets; Rivos supports the intense hardware requirements of the AI models and analytics that will remake the enterprise.""Rivos' first chipset is built on RISC-V, the open standard instruction set architecture (ISA).ISAs are a technical spec at the foundation of every chip, describing how software controls the chip's hardware. For general-purpose computing, chip design teams typically license an existing ISA from an incumbent (e.g., Arm or Intel). But RISC-V presents an open, no-royalties-attached alternative.Rivos' chip features what Kumar describes as a ""data parallel accelerator"" to speed up AI- and big data–related computations, essentially a GPU designed for purposes beyond graphics processing. It was made using TSMC's 3nm fabrication process. In chip manufacturing, ""process"" refers to the size of the smallest component that can be embedded on a chip.That 3nm is considered close to the cutting edge. While Qualcomm, MediaTek, Nvidia and AMD among others are expected to employ TSMC's process for their upcoming chip families, Apple was the only company to use it in 2024 in its M3 chipset series.In addition to building the chip, Rivos is working on self-contained data center hardware based on the Open Compute Project modular standard, which will effectively serve as plug-and-play chip housing. And it's creating a ""firmware-to-app"" software stack for programming the chip, Kumar said.""Customer workloads can be easily deployed on our more efficient hardware, but still using their existing models and databases, giving them an immediate benefit,"" Kumar added.Rivos, which is pre-revenue at the moment, plans to make money by charging customers — chiefly large data center operators — for its hardware and complementary software solutions. David Goel, an early investor, said that Rivos' ""low-friction"" adoption pipeline is a key differentiator in the cutthroat chip market.""The Rivos team has adeptly integrated the groundbreaking new RISC-V architecture with an inventive accelerator, effectively bringing this vision to life,"" Goel told TechCrunch. ""Their prototype chip serves as a compelling demonstration of their unique capability.""But is it differentiating enough?Big Tech firms — one of Rivos' potential customer segments — are racing to develop their own in-house chips for AI and big data analytics as the generative AI boom continues.Google's on its fifth-gen TPU and recently revealed Axion, its first dedicated chip for running models. Amazon has several custom chip families under its belt. Microsoft last year jumped into the fray with the Azure Maia AI Accelerator and the Azure Cobalt 100 CPU. And Meta's inching along with its own designs.Meanwhile, startups by the dozens are angling for a slice of a custom data center chip market that could reach $10 billion this year and double by 2025.Groq, a company developing chips to run AI models faster than conventional hardware, recently formed a new business unit geared toward enterprise applications and use cases. AI hardware startup Tenstorrent, helmed by engineering luminary Jim Keller, is looking to build its chipsets into data centers. And Rebellions, a South Korean fabless AI chip firm, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in capital to ramp up production of its data center–focused chip, Atom.But Nvidia, the dominant force in chips right now, is proving to be a tough one to topple.Nvidia briefly became a $2 trillion company this year, riding high on the demand for its GPUs for AI training. Wells Fargo Equity Research estimates that Nvidia has a 98% market share in data center GPUs, and the company's data center business was up more than 400% in Q4 2023 as Nvidia builds a new unit to design bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others.Given the fierceness of the competition — and the chilling effect Nvidia's supremacy has had on funding for would-be rivals — it's been rough going for some custom server chip upstarts.A few months ago, Graphcore, which reportedly had its valuation slashed by $1 billion after a deal with Microsoft fell through, said that it was planning job cuts due to the ""extremely challenging"" macroeconomic environment. Habana Labs, the Intel-owned AI chip company, laid off an estimated 10% of its workforce last year. Also last year, SiFive — like Rivos, an RISC-V startup — let go of 20% of its workforce and discontinued its core product line.So will Rivos fare better? Maybe.Kumar wouldn't talk about customers, and Rivos' chip isn't anticipated to reach mass production until sometime next year. But with 375 employees and hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank, Kumar said that Rivos is well-positioned to expand manufacturing and double down on platform and software engineering.“The rapid changes in generative AI and the merger with the data analytics stack makes it vital that accelerators be easy to program and debug, and that data can seamlessly move between CPU and accelerator,"" Kumar said. ""Rivos addresses this need through our 'recompile-not-redesign' approach.""This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/16/apple-lawsuit-behind-it-chip-startup-rivos-plots-its-next-moves/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-lawsuit-behind-chip-startup-100042396.html,AAPL,0.065,0.026000000000000002,0.909,0.9929,Positive,169.5200958251953,168.53729248046875,-0.5797562465632414,-1

2024-04-12 16:55:00,Apple’s Services business is a bright spot in the company’s rough 2024: BofA,"Apple’s (AAPL) 2024 has been rough so far. But despite the company’s headwinds ranging from antitrust suits to slowing iPhone sales, there’s one big bright spot for Apple: its Services business. In the first quarter, Services revenue jumped 11% year over year to $6.3 billion.And according to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple is set to report another quarter of double-digit growth for the segment when it announces its second-quarter earnings later this month.Apple’s Services business includes the company’s App Store sales, advertising revenue, AppleCare+, subscription services like Apple TV+, and more. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, App Store revenue grew 11% in the first quarter of the year, up from 3% in the first quarter of 2023 and 5% in Q1 2022.Apple’s App Store also appears to be surviving the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) without much issue. The legislation, which went into effect in March, forces both Apple and Google to allow consumers to download and install third-party app stores and notify users that they can switch to third-party web browsers.Sensor Tower data indicates that while App Store in-app spending grew 13% globally in March, it increased 28% in the EU.“Although the DMA has been in effect for roughly one month, it appears there has been no significant impact to Apple’s revenue from in-app purchases (or subscriptions),” the firm stated.According to Reuters, EU-based user numbers for third-party browsers like Aloha increased 250% in March.But with more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices in circulation, the company isn’t likely to face much of an impact from third-party browser installs. In fact, according to Mohan, App Store installs in the EU have increased 2% year over year since the DMA went into effect, while revenue rose 24%.That said, Apple also requires app developers that offer apps via third-party app stores to pay a 50-euro cent ""core technology"" fee for each app users install after the first million installs. Apple says the fee is necessary to maintain app security and upkeep, but the European Union's antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, is looking into whether Apple is violating the terms of the DMA.For now, however, Apple’s Services business continues to perform well at a time when the company’s other segments are facing declining revenue. In Q1, Apple reported an 11% drop in its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, while its iPad business revenue plummeted 25% in the quarter.And while iPhone sales increased 6% year over year in Q1, they declined 13% in China, Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. Part of that problem has to do with China’s tepid economic environment, but the company is also contending with a resurgent Huawei as well as other home-grown smartphone makers stealing away market share.Apple’s iPad business is also facing difficulties, with revenue declining 3% in 2023 and 8% in 2022.On the legal front, the Department of Justice is suing Apple for allegedly stymying competition in the smartphone space. The European Union has also fined the company $2 billion over antitrust concerns related to music streaming services.We’ll find out more about Apple’s performance in the quarter when it reports its fiscal Q2 results May 2.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The company is grappling with weak sales in China and a Justice Department suit accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws, taking aim at its lucrative services business. Shares edged higher on Thursday.Apple is seen as trailing peers when it comes to artificial-intelligence offerings and the company has been looking for partners like Google to add AI features to its iPhones. This prospect is also boosting sentiment as there’s growing appetite for AI-led iPhone enhancements, according to JPMorgan.“Hedge fund investors are increasingly warming up to the opportunity of the AI upgrade cycle,” although questions remain around whether that will kick in with iPhones to be introduced later this year or in 2025, analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a research note Thursday.Chatterjee, who has an overweight rating on the company, said “hedge funds are eyeing the headwinds to create more tactical entry point ahead of the AI upgrade cycle.”Apple now trades at about 24 times forward earnings, a discount to megacap peers such as Microsoft Corp. and even a little cheaper than the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Our conversations indicate that investors are waiting for further recalibration of the near-term estimates, which in their view will be accompanied by setting up an even more attractive valuation multiple as an entry point heading into the AI upgrade cycle,” Chatterjee wrote.(Updates to add stock move in second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of AgingToyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and HyundaiEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

Farbiarz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Farbiarz and Neals were both appointed to the bench by Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden. Neals has served since 2021 and formerly worked as a New Jersey county government lawyer. Farbiarz has served since last year, leaving his position as general counsel to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.Farbiarz's recusal order appeared to come without any request from Apple or the Justice Department. The government declined to comment on Wednesday. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Justice Department, along with 15 U.S. states, sued Apple in March, accusing the Cupertino, California-based tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market through restrictions on app developers that curb choice and innovation, which it said forces consumers to pay higher prices.Apple has denied the allegations and said the lawsuit ""threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.""The lawsuit spurred related private civil lawsuits from consumers and businesses.

2024-04-11 15:10:00,Apple's India production line assembles $14B in devices: BBG,"One out of every seven of Apple's (AAPL) iPhones are reportedly assembled in India, according to Bloomberg, which is valued at up to $14 billion in Apple products. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins Yahoo Finance to detail Apple's international manufacturing strategy as it seeks to expand its output past just facilities in China.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.MADISON MILLS: Apple's iPhone output in India is ramping up. A new report from Bloomberg suggesting one in every seven iPhones is assembled in India. That would total about $14 billion worth of output there. With more, we have Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley joining us. Dan, what does this output from India telling us about, maybe, diversification away from China.DANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah, Maddie, that's really the main story here. I mean, there's two elements to it here. It's the diversifying away from China, ensuring that should anything go sour between the US-- and I guess-- more sour between the US and China, that Apple has a manufacturing hub that it doesn't have to tiptoe around. And so China could be that, so could Vietnam and other countries.But in addition to that, it's part of Apple's strategy of being able to physically have a footprint in the country as far as retail sales go. So they opened up their first flagship store in Mumbai. Tim Cook was there. And so this is something that the company is heavily leaning into.And so just to put that $14 billion into perspective that one in seven iPhones, in Q1 alone, the company sold $69.7 million worth of iPhones. And in 2023, it had $200.6 billion in iPhone revenue. So it's still a relatively small number of iPhones being built in India.But if you look on Apple's website, if you look on different job boards, there are plenty of jobs open for Apple in India. So you can only imagine that they're going to continue to try to woo some companies to help them build out in India. That includes Foxconn, Pegatron, those contract builders for Apple, as well as Indian Prime Minister Modi.MADISON MILLS: All right, Dan. Thank you so much for joining us. Looks like Apple is part of the overall downturn we're seeing in the market today, down nearly 1% here.

2024-04-11 14:03:00,"Apple Stock Has 33% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","Investors are worried over declining iPhone sales at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- reported to be down 9% in the U.S. in February, and twice that in China. They are also worried that Apple's lack of a homegrown artificial intelligence product could seriously damage Apple's share price this year. Together those worries go some way to explaining why share prices of the iPhone maker are down about 13% since the start of 2024.But not all hope is lost. Bank of America analysts still think Apple stock is a buy and could rise as much as 34% to hit $225 within a year.Why does BofA believe Apple stock is a buy? In a note out Tuesday, the investment bank cited a 10% rise in Q2 sales at the App Store as a reason to own Apple stock. March data look particularly good, with global App Store sales up 13% (although only up 7% in China).App Store sales -- and sales of other services, as opposed to hardware -- may be key to Apple's growth rate going forward. On the one hand, Apple had the largest market share of any phone maker globally in Q4, and globally, its phones dominate with 1.5 billion iPhones in use. On the other hand, by this point, anyone who wants an iPhone probably already has one, limiting further hardware growth to sales of replacement iPhones, and new devices yet to be invented. Sales of services such as apps, on the other hand, aren't limited in the same way hardware sales are and could continue growing.The bad news, though, is that most analysts forecast Apple's earnings growth over the next five years will average only about 10% per year -- or essentially the same growth rate BofA just cited for App Store sales. This reinforces the impression that Apple is no longer a high-growth stock. If ""10%"" is the best growth rate we can expect from Apple going forward, it's a very real question whether investors should continue to pay more than 26 times earnings for Apple stock.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-11 14:00:00,Gold rises to near record highs even as interest rate cut hopes fade,"Gold is shining bright among investors even as faith that central banks will make hefty cuts to interest rates this year dims.The spot price of gold (GC=F) has risen to $2,354.20 per ounce, hovering near record highs, meaning gold has now risen over 14% since the start of 2024.“Strong underlying momentum with the buy-on-dip still the prevailing strategy among traders,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.“Geopolitical risks related to Russia/Ukraine and the Middle East are still playing a supporting role, and the focus is changing from the negative impact of lower rate cut expectations towards higher and sticky inflation,” he added.Gold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven in difficult times, and as a hedge against inflation.The precious metal has had a record-breaking run since mid-February, boosted by expectations for US rate cuts, geopolitical tensions and China’s economic woes.Futures traders have reduced bets on how much the US Federal Reserve will cut rates this year to the lowest level since October.Traders now expect fewer than three quarter-point cuts to US interest rates this year, down from up to six cuts expected in January.High interest rates usually constrain the appeal of holding non-yielding gold, but the precious metal has been ignoring these factors so far. The market is waiting for the US Federal Reserve’s policy meeting minutes and US inflation data due on Wednesday for fresh signals on future US rate path.Read more: UK interest rate cut more likely as pay growth slowsSome central banks have also been adding to their gold reserves, with China’s central bank purchasing gold for its reserves for a 17th straight month in March.Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco said that concerns around the US debt could be pushing some towards the precious metal.“Then there is the concern about US debt and the long-term unsustainability of the US’ fiscal situation. That seems to have caused some central banks to increase holdings at the expense of US Treasuries,” she said.Analysts at Bank of America said in a note that gold could rally to $3,000 per ounce by 2025.Markets are volatile and therefore so are investments but given the safe-haven status of gold, the precious metal would have been a safe bet to park your money.If you have put £100 in gold in 2023 you would now have £121. However, despite the precious metal rally, had you put those same £100 in bitcoin (BTC-USD), you would today have £396.Surprisingly, this one commodity performed also as good as the cryptocurrency. Cocoa (CC=F) is up by around 270%, which would have secured you £373.Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) shares, two of the Magnificent Seven, would have also outperformed gold. However, their track record shows far more volatility that most investors might be comfortable with, as is the case with Bitcoin.Gold falls under the category of alternative investments, named like that as they are usually defined as alternatives to traditional investment assets, such as bonds and equities. They can be anything from art to property, hedge fund investments, gold and gold funds, and digital assets.For those wanting to protect their investment portfolio from market uncertainty, it is worth considering gold.Anyone can invest in physical gold in the form of bars and gold coins. The Royal Mint has recorded a 7% increase in investors purchasing gold bullion last year.Read more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks push higher ahead of key US inflation reportHowever, it might be easier and cheaper to invest in gold through Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or Exchange-traded commodity (ETC) products.Another way to go about it is to invest in shares of gold mining companies, which should get you dividends as you are investing in a business and not purely on the precious metal.Let's take a look at these three ways to invest in gold.It is probably the first image on our mind when we thing about the precious metal: a gold bar or coins. If you go down this route you are investing in the physical metal.Gold coins are a popular choice but mostly for collectors as you will pay a premium for the design that you might not get back. However, some coins become more desirable for collectors over time so the gambit could pay off.If you're not bothered by the aesthetic value of gold, the straight way to go about it is to get a cast bar. A 500g will set you back £30,565 if you purchase it from the Royal Mint.Read more: King Charles gold bullion coin unveiled by Royal MintHowever, you can start smaller, with a 2.5g bar coming in at around £170. Regardless of what you get, make you the purity is above 99.9% for coins and 99.95% for bars, so that it is VAT free.Gold and other precious metals are often weighed in troy ounces. At 31.1034768 grams, one troy ounce is about 10% heavier than a regular ounce.If you look at gold purely as an investment and do not want to handle things like storage or purity levels you can pick to invest in an ETF or ETC.These investment products are funds that consist of only one asset: gold. They trade just like a normal stock but gets its value from holding 'underlying assets' that are centred on the precious metal, like the physical metal, gold futures or exposure to companies that mine the metal.The main costs of investing in gold ETFs will be the ongoing charge and any platform fees. You should also pay attention to where the product trades.Most physical gold is priced in US dollars, so if an ETF or ETC operates in sterling then the USD/GBP (GBP=X) rate will likely play a role a significant role in its performance.Looking at gold ETFs traded in the USA, the DB Gold Double Long Exchange Traded Notes (DGP) has returned 26% so far this year.Read more: How to supercharge your pension this yearProShares Ultra (UGL) has delivered 24.99% and Invesco DB Precious Metals Fund (DBP) has recorded a 14.09% gain since January, according to data from VettaFi.If you want to keep things in pounds, you some top gold ETFs in the UK include the Invesco Physical Gold ETC (SGLPL.XC), that comes with a 0.12% fee, and aims to replicate the spot price movement of gold bullion as closely as possible.There is also the iShares Physical Gold ETC (SGLNL.XC), for the same fee. This product has the particularly of only accepting gold bullion that meets the Good Delivery standards set by the London Bullion Market Association. All assets are classified as responsibly sourced, only allocating gold that was mined after 2022.Gold-oriented stocks and shares provide exposure to the commodity without the cost of buying and storing it.You are investing in a company, just like you would do with any other listed business, but in this case you secure the exposure to gold but could potentially attain higher returns as gold companies can expand production and reduce costs, which can drive profits. As you own shares in the company, you could also be in line for dividends.In the US, Galiano Gold (GAU) would have been your best bet. Shares in the company have gained 188%, considerably more than our number two.Second place goes to Equinox Gold (EQX), with shares almost doubling. ElDorado Gold (EGO) shares come in at number three, with an 85% increase, according to data from investment platform AJ Bell.Again, if you prefer to keep your investments UK-bound, investing in Empire Metals (EEE.L) would have secured you a 397% return in you invested at the start of last year. That means that £100 of shares are now worth close to £400. It is the best performing US-listed gold mining share since January 2023.Serabi Gold (SRB.L) has climbed over 100%, meaning you would've doubled your investment, same with Resolute Mining (RSG.L).As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results and gold should be part of a diversified portfolio.Watch: Why are gold prices suddenly hitting record highs?Download the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/gold-record-high-interest-rate-cut-hopes-140042155.html,AAPL,0.156,0.033,0.8109999999999999,0.9996,Positive,167.4250030517578,168.75999450683594,0.797366839327711,1

The option debuted in January, but only for iOS users in the U.S.In an update to the X @Safety account on Monday, the company shared that passkeys are now available as a login option for global iOS users. Similar technology has already been added to other popular apps and services, including PayPal, TikTok, WhatsApp, GitHub and others. Google last fall made passkeys the default sign-in option for all users. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and other companies also support the option.Update: Passkeys is now available as a login option for everyone globally on iOS! Try it out.https://t.co/v1LyN0l8wF— Safety (@Safety) April 8, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsPasskey technology was initiated by Google, Apple, Microsoft and the FIDO Alliance, alongside the World Wide Web Consortium. The idea is to make passwordless logins available across different devices, operating systems and web browsers. Unlike traditional logins, which require a username and password combination, passkeys use biometric authentication like Face ID or Touch ID, a PIN or a physical security authentication key to validate logins.

2024-04-10 15:45:00,I lead one of the startups accusing Apple of patent infringement. Here’s why Congress should side with us,"When I became CEO of AliveCor, a health tech startup dedicated to heart health, little did I know that we would spend years engaged in a legal fight to protect our intellectual property from one of the largest companies in the world. But our David vs. Goliath battle against Apple has even reached President Joe Biden’s desk–and, now, the halls of Congress.Some people ask me why we haven’t given up, given Apple’s massive war chest and well-documented history of copying other firms’ ideas. As The Washington Post once reported, “Some apps have simply buckled under the pressure.”But this isn’t just about us. It’s about the entire tech ecosystem. It’s a question of whether startups–and small businesses of all kinds–can stand up for their rights and win. And because we focus specifically on health tech, it’s no exaggeration to say that when it comes to technologies developed by companies like ours, lives hang in the balance.Here’s what the case is all about, in a nutshell. AliveCor pioneered electrocardiogram technologies (ECG) for smartphones and smartwatches. In 2016 we launched KardiaBand, an FDA-cleared, medical-grade wearable ECG. The responses were wonderful, with people saying it helped to transform their health and their lives. But two years later, Apple announced that it had created its own technology–and made its new watches incompatible with a central feature of KardiaBand.Equipped with patents, scientific reports, and other evidence, we fought back. Since then, Apple has tried all sorts of maneuvers to fend us off, including bombarding us with expensive litigation. Nevertheless, we’ve been winning before the International Trade Commission (ITC). The agency’s role includes investigating and making determinations involving intellectual property (IP) rights in such cases.The ITC found Apple to be in violation of the IP protecting our vital heart monitoring technology. As a result, the commission ultimately called for a ban on Apple importing its infringing watches into the United States. The corporate behemoth tried to get President Biden to veto that ban, but fortunately, he declined to do so.We’re not alone in this kind of fight. Another medical technology company, Masimo, has been engaged in a similar battle, and also won before the ITC. Again, Biden refused to veto an Apple Watch import ban.But rather than attempt to rectify its wrongs, Apple is trying to use its lobbying power to change the ITC. The company is lobbying Congress to “make some patent owners ineligible to bring complaints before the ITC,” and seeking “to influence the language of committee reports that could affect how the agency levels punishments.”Apple is also trying another desperate, last-ditch effort. It got the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board to invalidate some of our patents, but we’re confident that our appeal will reverse that decision.Apple is attempting to argue that an ITC ban on Apple Watch imports would deprive people of a device that is crucial to their health. However, the commission has previously dismissed this argument as inaccurate. In fact, the opposite is true: Allowing Apple to get away with continued infringement will kill innovation and endanger people’s health.Health tech startups rely on investor funding to save lives. People are willing to invest in these new ideas because they expect that some will succeed, so they’ll recoup their investments and see a future payoff.If large corporations can simply copy these technologies, then investors will lose the confidence and incentive to provide funding at various stages. Investors and small business leaders need to know that the rules fairly and reliably protect the Davids in the same way that they protect the Goliaths.Our battle against Apple has always taken place on an uneven field. The intervention of Congress on Apple’s behalf would make things even worse. President Biden stood up to Apple’s bullying tactics–and Congress should do the same.Priya Abani is the CEO of AliveCor.Glassdoor CEO: ‘Anonymous posts will always stay anonymous’We analyzed 46 years of consumer sentiment data–and found that today’s ‘vibecession’ is just men starting to feel as bad about the economy as women historically have90% of homebuyers have historically opted to work with a real estate agent or broker.

2024-04-10 15:28:00,Key analyst explains why Apple is still worth betting on in the short term,"KeyBanc Capital Markets said Monday that March iPhone sales were up 9% month-over-month, though they were down 15% year-over-year. The dip is representative of the ongoing headwinds Apple is facing in China. Wedbush's Dan Ives, however, said that there are plenty of reasons to remain bullish on Apple in the near-term. This year, shares of Apple  (AAPL)  — down about 12% for 2024 — have been performing toward the lower end of its group of Magnificent Seven peers.The stock pressure comes amid a storm of challenges for the iPhone-makers, the most significant of which seems centered around weakening iPhone sales and headwinds from China, which has long been a key market for Apple.Apple in January was hit with downgrades from Piper Sandler and Barclays, with Piper Sandler analysts writing in a note: ""We are concerned about handset inventories ... and also feel that growth rates have peaked for unit sales ... deteriorating macro environment in China could also weigh on handset business.""KeyBanc Capital Markets said Monday that domestic March iPhone sales increased 9% month-over-month, though they were still down 15% year-over-year.Analysts at KeyBanc lowered their iPhone estimates by 2.2%, saying: ""Overall, our data is telling us we should expect below-average growth for F2Q24, when we see potential for a miss/lower during earnings.""In the midst of Apple's struggle to get a better handle on iPhone sales, the company shuttered Project Titan, its electric car project, and was hit with a massive antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice.As part of its move to kill Project Titan, Apple also recently laid off 600 California employees.While the news coming out of Apple has been negative lately, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives doesn't think there's reason to panic yet.Related: Key analyst says latest Apple move would be a 'horror show'Ives said in a Tuesday note that while Apple is facing a ""perfect storm"" of challenges, especially in China, where competition from Huawei is heating up, the story might not be as bad as it seems.Citing a recent trip to Asia, Ives said that Chinese iPhone sales are holding steady with initial projections from the beginning of 2024. While this is ""not a positive result per se,"" Ives said that it is ""better than had been feared.""""We believe while China has clearly performed below expectations, other regions including the U.S., Europe and India have been relatively strong in the March quarter and will help balance out a soft China number,"" he said.Still, Ives noted that with 20% of iPhone sales coming from China, Apple needs to ""turn this headwind into a tailwind"" when the iPhone 16 is released in the Fall.His case for a persistently bullish Apple outlook is based on a few factors, one of which is that he believes current full-year iPhone sales estimates are still ""hittable.""Ives also noted Apple's massive installed base — consisting of 2.2 billion IOS devices — saying that demand around a coming upgrade cycle could ""exceed 270 million iPhones"" heading into the release of Apple's newest iPhone.Ives additionally remains confident that Apple's June unveiling of its work in artificial intelligence will supercharge the company's performance.""While some patience is required to navigate this China weakness, we believe the seeds for an Apple growth turnaround are being planted in the field,"" he said.Ives maintained an ""outperform"" rating and a $250 price target, which remains the highest Apple price target out there.The average Apple price target, according to TipRanks, is $202.Shares of Apple lifted slightly following market open Tuesday.Contact Ian with tips and AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/key-analyst-explains-why-apple-152838606.html,AAPL,0.077,0.054000000000000006,0.8690000000000001,0.9066,Positive,168.66000366210938,167.92269897460938,-0.4371544358418869,-1
2024-04-10 15:14:00,Warren Buffett’s Portfolio: 15 Longest Held Stocks,"In this piece, we will take a look at Warren Buffett's portfolio and the 15 longest held stocks. If you want to skip our introduction to the Oracle of Omaha, his stocks, and trading strategies, then you can skip ahead to Warren Buffett's Portfolio: 5 Longest Held Stocks. Warren Buffett is the most successful investor in Wall Street history. His net worth is currently estimated to sit at a cool $138 billion according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, and this comes after Buffett has donated billions of dollars to charitable causes. Unlike most other billionaires, who love to live in mansions and drive fancy cars, Buffett is perhaps one of the most down-to-earth billionaires in the world, as he drives himself to work and still lives in the same house he did before making wealth greater than the budgets of several countries.So, what's the key to Buffett's success? Well, if we were to embark on the near impossible task of trying to describe the Oracle's successes in two words, it would be prudence and patience.Buffett invests in stocks primarily through his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway. Like hedge funds, Berkshire also files its investment holdings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Insider Monkey regularly compiles such data to provide readers who've subscribed to our newsletter with the trading insights of professionals, and our analysis of Warren Buffett's latest investment portfolio shows that Berkshire Hathaway had piled in a whopping $347 billion in different stocks by the end of Q4 2023. Interestingly, as opposed to the general mantra of diversification that's taught in college level finance courses and MBA classes worldwide, Berkshire's investment portfolio is anything but. The concentration of Buffett's billions shows his unshakeable belief in the stocks that he picks, and for the latest investment portfolio, a cool $174 billion or 50% was invested in a single stock i.e. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).His investing philosophy has been shaped over the decades that Buffett has spent playing with stocks and traces its roots back to the mid-1900s when investors were just starting to exploit the differences between the perceived fair value of a stock and its market price. This approach is called Value Investing, and Insider Monkey has covered this approach quite deeply. For instance, apart from Buffett, another well known value investor is Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, and you can learn more about this by reading 12 Best Value Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2024 (Picked By Seth Klarman).For Buffett, one of his most memorable and remarkable 'trifles' on the stock market came when he applied the principles of value investing to the shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). American Express was the firm that introduced credit cards to America, and Buffett realized the potential (or competitive moat) that this had for the firm's share price. When Amex's shares tanked in the 1960s due to lack of oversight at a subsidiary, the Oracle nearly went all in and started buying the shares as he realized that the fair value of the stock was noticeably different than what investors were ascribing it in the market.Recalling the decision in a letter to Berkshire's shareholders, Buffett explained:Last year I referred to one investment which substantially outperformed the general market in 1964, 1965 and 1966 and because of its size (the largest proportion we have ever had in anything – we hit our 40% limit) had a very material impact on our overall results and, even more so, this category. This excellent performance continued throughout 1967 and a large portion of total gain was again accounted for by this single security. Our holdings of this security have been very substantially reduced and we have nothing in this group remotely approaching the size or potential which formerly existed in this investment.So, which stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio are his longest held stocks? We took a look and some notable ones are American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO).Our MethodologyTo make our list of Warren Buffett's longest held stocks, we sifted through his Q4 2023 investment portfolio and picked out those stocks that he has consistently held for the longest time period.Why pay attention to what Buffett is doing?

It's always earnings season when you cover markets, right? We saw the Mag Seven companies continue to dominate the conversation, especially around growth. Some of the more troubled companies in that group, your Apples, your Teslas starting to slide.So could the Magnificent Seven's reign be coming to an end? Joining us to discuss we have Jeffrey Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist. Jeffrey, I want to get into the Magnificent Seven's kind of decline here. But I do want to start with what's going to be more important this week in your view, the CPI data coming out tomorrow or the start of earnings season here?JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Well, I guess, it's almost a tie. I think one of the things that really does matter is the CPI number, and that's tied to the outlook for oil prices oil. You know, oil has just been an absolute terror-- up to 20% this year. Today at noon, we're going to get the oil report from the US Energy Information Agency. And the energy sector has been the best performing sector of the stock market over the past month. Oil demand might be revised higher in today's report given the strengthening global economic data.And that could push oil to a new high on the year along with all those geopolitical concerns we're so aware of-- war returning to the Middle East, oil tankers under attack in the Red Sea, Ukraine targeting Russian energy infrastructure, all of that. So even a temporary move higher could further boost the energy sector. But at the same time, a major and sustained upward move in oil prices could negatively impact inflation and worsen the outlook for rate cuts.SEANA SMITH: So what does that mean then for the broader equity market?JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Well, I think it's good news for sectors like industrials and financials and energy and materials, areas that have started to lean in the last couple of months, but probably bad news for the tech sectors and other parts of the market that are more momentum-driven and might be more dependent on the flood of a return of liquidity from the Fed and other central banks.MADISON MILLS: Well, I want to get your take Jeffrey on this note from Wells Fargo because we have this note obviously pushing the price target up to $55.35. I want to pull up a quote. He says, ""the bull market, Au's secular growth story, and index concentration have shifted investors' attention away from traditional valuation measures and toward longer term growth and discounting metrics."" So my question for you, if valuations don't matter, why wouldn't the Magnificent Seven continue to have growth?JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Well, you know, we were in a different environment over the last 18 months than the environment we've started into now. Over the last 18 months, we've seen the Magnificent Seven companies deliver spectacular earnings growth as part of a longer-term trajectory of very strong growth while the rest of the market delivered well, nothing. Earnings declines. That is changing.This is the last quarter here, Q1, where analysts are expecting the Magnificent Seven earnings growth to be positive while the rest of the market is expected to be negative. I'm not just talking about the S&P 500, but globally speaking, negative earnings growth, that's expected to flip over the remainder of the year. By the fourth quarter, the earnings growth for the rest of the market is expected to eclipse the growth in the Mag Seven, and that might further shift away from the Mag Seven to other sectors where earnings are improving.SEANA SMITH: Jeffrey, when it comes to some improvement in earnings, is that going to solidify some of that rotation that we've seen away from the Mag Seven into some of those more beaten down names or areas of the market that hasn't necessarily participated in this rally over the last several months? And then what does that say just to that momentum potentially increasing here in the coming months?JEFFREY KLEINTOP: Yeah, I think it's good for the overall market. It's kind of a second wind for the stock market. We've been so powered by those Mag Seven stocks, and now they're showing some signs of weakening as you pointed out with Tesla and some of the others. We're starting to see new life from other sectors.Analysts outlook for broadening earnings growth isn't just hope. It's supported by the Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index-- my favorite economic statistic. That rose to 50.6 in March. That release marked the second month in a row above 50.0, the dividing line between growth and recession, after spending 18 months below 50, the longest in manufacturing recession since it began 30 years ago.Now, historically, when global manufacturing PMI is above 50, that means earnings growth is broadly rising. That's where we are now. So expect to see better earnings revisions in those sectors like industrials, financials, materials, and energy.

That includes Beeper co-founder Eric Migicovsky, who will become Automattic’s head of messaging.The buyer, which also owns the Tumblr and Longreads websites, is paying $125 million for the business, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed.The deal is part of a bid to make online messaging a key part of Automattic’s business. Beeper, which first launched as a beta test in 2021, is a universal chat app that taps into several different messaging services to create one unified inbox. The service, with about 100,000 users, works with apps like Facebook Messenger, Signal and Slack.“There’s basically no open standard for chat, and our vision is to create that by connecting to legacy chat networks,” Migicovsky said in an interview.Migicovsky originally made his name by developing the Pebble, a smartwatch that predated the Apple Watch. More recently, he has been a key figure in the antitrust scrutiny of Apple. The startup released a version of its software last year called Beeper Mini that allowed Apple’s iMessage to run on the rival Android platform. That irked the tech giant, which blocked the app from working.Migicovsky had been a vocal proponent of reining in Apple’s power, and the spat caught the eye of regulators.

2024-04-10 14:00:00,Apple is aiming the Vision Pro at enterprises,"It’s been just over two months since Apple (APPL) launched its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. At $3,500, the device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, is a pricey proposition for many consumers. But the enterprise market is another beast altogether, which is why the company is keen on showing off the Vision Pro’s business bona fides. After all, if Apple can entice large businesses to purchase Vision Pros in bulk, it would provide a solid boost to overall sales numbers.Apple has a history of pushing what might seem to be consumer products into businesses. The iPhone is a mainstay of offices around the world, as are its MacBook and Mac lines of laptops and desktops. And while Apple doesn't release numbers for how many of its product sales go toward consumers and how many go toward businesses, having those enterprise clients all but guarantees a continuous stream of upgrades as older devices reach the end of their lifecycles and newer, more powerful ones come to market.To that end, I sat down for a demo of some of the enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro and came away impressed by what the headset has to offer. Much of what the company offers seemed to provide genuinely worthwhile use cases for workers, though, I'm not a jet engine mechanic, so I can't say for sure.And while these were enterprise apps, they still managed to feel as immersive as their consumer-based counterparts. Though, I don't expect anyone to start downloading them from the App Store for fun.Apple isn’t alone in the AR/VR enterprise space. Rival Meta (META) also offers its Meta Quest line of headsets as a business product complete with enterprise-focused administrative software and controls.Still, demonstrating the Vision Pro's enterprise chops could prove to be a lucrative move for Apple as it ramps up headset sales in hopes of turning the device into a major moneymaker.During my brief 30-minute demo with Apple, I tried four different apps: SAP Analytics Cloud, Complete HeartX, Resolve, and JigSpace. Each of the apps featured interactive augmented reality functionality designed to help workers do everything from training for specific tasks and studying pieces of equipment they may have to service in the future to getting a better understanding of their business’s overall performance.The most impressive demo of the bunch was Complete HeartX. The app, developed by Elsevier, is designed to help healthcare workers, such as nursing students, get a better sense of how the heart functions in a living person and how to draw blood.Users see a fully 3D model of a person and use their hands to pinpoint a spot of the model’s body to reveal the location of blood vessels, veins, and the heart. The app also offers a 3D model of a beating heart that helps users better understand how blood flows throughout the body.SAP Analytics Cloud, meanwhile, allows users to view datasets in a 3D environment, making them easier to digest than simply reading them on a spreadsheet. The demo I saw involved viewing a corporate headquarters with small pegs floating above each building.Looking at a building and tapping my fingers together pulled up the number of employees that worked in each building on specific days. It also provided a breakdown of how many people parked at the complex’s parking garages and whether they drove EVs or traditional gas-powered cars.The Resolve app allowed me to view a schematic of an HVAC system and then see a digital version of it at scale above me. The idea is to give HVAC workers a sense of where things like air ducts and sprinkler heads are located before going to a job site, so they don't have to waste time searching while on the job.Then there was my demo of JigSpace, which entailed placing a massive jet engine in a room and pulling it apart by staring at individual pieces to select them and tapping my fingers together to tear them out.Each of the demos offered excellent visuals and interactivity, but I didn’t see anything that other headsets don't offer. I’ve used AR/VR devices in the past to perform faux surgery on 3D models of people, look at accurate representations of things like cars and planes, and more.The Vision Pro does, however, bring along an incredibly easy-to-use interface, interoperability with other Apple devices, and an overall cleaner operating system. If Apple can convince a relatively small number of businesses to purchase the Vision Pro, it could give the headset a nice sales boost.We’ll likely get some inkling as to overall Vision Pro uptake when Apple announces its second quarter earnings in the coming weeks.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

2024-04-09 17:30:00,Could Apple Help You Retire a Millionaire?,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made a lot of millionaires over the years, with its shares up 792% over the last decade. However, it hit some roadblocks in 2024, with its stock down 11% year to date.Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company last year, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with the tech giant posting revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.However, outperforming estimates hasn't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of Apple's business. In the first quarter of 2024, the company's iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales yet they fell 13% in China. The East Asian country increasingly prefers domestic brands over the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.Then, on March 4, Apple's stock dipped again after news broke that the European Commission had hit the company with a $2 billion antitrust fine over concerns for its music streaming service. Despite recent headwinds, Apple remains a leader in tech with dominating brand power and immense financial resources. The question remains: Is Apple still a millionaire maker, and could it make you one by the time you retire?It's hard to deny Apple's powerful position in tech. The company has leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.The popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. This chart shows that Apple's free cash flow is considerably higher than some of the top names in tech. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing it to continue investing in its business.While declining sales in China are concerning for now, growth in other regions could offset losses over the long term while the company gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.Moreover, the recent launch of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could become a key growth catalyst in the coming years. The VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030.Apple may be new to the industry, but it has a reputation for entering new sectors and quickly rising to dominance. As a result, an investment in Apple today could be an investment in the future leader of the $20 billion VR market.Apple is on a promising growth path and has a long history of reliability. Its dominant role in tech and investments in budding industries like VR/AR and artificial intelligence (AI) will likely fuel its stock price for years.This chart shows Apple's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying this figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26 yields a share price of $208, projecting stock growth of 23% over the next two fiscal years. These projections would likely see Apple continue to outperform the S&P 500, which has increased by 13% over the last two years.As a result, Apple's stock remains an attractive addition to a diversified portfolio. Its significant cash reserves and potent brand make it an excellent option to hold over many years, as one does when preparing for retirement. I wouldn't bet against Apple's reliability and tendency to deliver major gains over the long term.If you're less than five years from retirement, there are likely better options than Apple as it will need time to overcome recent headwinds. However, if you're an early stage investor with 20 or more years to go, the right investment can help make you a millionaire by the time you retire, and Apple stock could play a useful part in helping you achieve that goal.Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-04-09 16:02:00,Spotify Goes A Step Further On Its AI Journey,"Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE: SPOT) continues to integrate AI into its music streaming offerings. On Friday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced changes that should benefit Spotify and other streaming apps as it will now inform users of other ways to purchase digital services on its App Store. This change came as result the $1.99 billion fine Apple was charged by the EU for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals through its Apple Store restrictions.Perhaps not the greatest rivalry of all time, but the Apple Music and Spotify rivalry is undoubtedly among the music streaming industry’s greats. Spotify has been around for longer than Apple Music. Yet, Apple made an impressive digital music footprint and used its iPhone power to make things trickier for Spotify. By the looks of it, the EU regulators have put an end to those days. Strangely, Apple has been late in in infusing AI to enhance its offerings. While Apple has been keeping quiet on AI, it did add personalized recommendations last year, back when Spotify expanded its AI DJ. Generative AI has quickly grown to become much more than a simple buzzword, so Apple cannot afford to take a back seat but it’s nature has always been about being secretive- only time will show how it intends to infuse it across its offerings.Last February, Spotify launched its AI-powered DJ feature. Six months after the North America and Canada debut, it expanded it to dozens of markets across the globe. An English-speaking personalized radio DJ has been a success. Now, Spotify took the next step by launching personalized AI playlists that one can build using written prompts. Moreover, besides allowing users to specify their musical wishes beyond the genre with prompts referencing a range of things, from moods to movie characters, activities, and so on, AI can be used to further refine the result after the list is generated. At first, the feature will be available to U.K. and Australia.Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has also offered many teasers of ways the music streaming company can exploit AI, such as by summarizing podcasts and creating AI-generated audio ads. With AI-powered capabilities, Spotify can personalize its offerings like never before while also gaining the ability to become more efficient such as by significantly lowering the cost that it takes for advertisers to develop new ad formats. In simple words, the DJ feature was merely the beginning of Spotify’s AI journey.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

2024-04-09 15:38:00,"Tesla, Apple, Nvidia: Factors keeping these stocks popular","Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) — often referred to as members of the Magnificent 7 group of tech stocks — have had varying performances in 2024 so far. According to a new report from Charles Schwab, these tech leaders continue to remain popular among retail investors going forward.Charles Schwab Director of Trading and Education Joe Mazzola joins The Morning Brief to discuss why these companies remain popular amongst retail investors and takes a look at potential trends for the upcoming earnings season that may impact these stocks.Mazzola expands upon the report and why these stocks remain popular: ""I think with Nvidia, you can make case that AI remains strong amongst the investor base. They want to participate in that, and Nvidia is the leader of the pack. And I think with Apple and Tesla... retail investors tend to look for buying opportunities for names that they've owned in the past. And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear under performers in the Mag. 7 at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino[AUDIO LOGO]JARED BLIKRE: Two stocks investors are keeping an eye on, Tesla and Apple. Tesla is the biggest loser year-to-date in the S&P 500, down about 33%, 34% as of Friday. Apple down 12%. Now, a new report from Charles Schwab shows that they continue to remain popular among retail investors.And let's bring in now Joe Mazzola, Charles Schwab director of trading and education to discuss more. Joe, not a big surprise here. We have what we call Yahoo Finance Trending Tickers, and it's based on the traffic to all our ticker pages. And guess what? Nvidia, Tesla, Apple almost always rounding out the top three here.JOE MAZZOLA: Yeah. No, I think with Nvidia, you can make the case that AI remains strong amongst the investor base. They want to participate in that, and Nvidia is the leader of the pack there. And I think with Apple and Tesla, I mean, look, retail investors tend to look for dip-buying opportunities for names that they've owned in the past.And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear underperformers in the Mag Seven at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago.SEANA SMITH: Joe, what's driving that investor confidence that you clearly are seeing over the last several months? And then when we look ahead to the future, what is that indicative of just in terms of some of the future trends that we could potentially see?JOE MAZZOLA: Well, let me just throw some numbers on there. So the STAX number that we came out with-- and remember, this is based upon activity. So this is behavioral index as opposed to attitudinal-- jumped up to 51.65 this month or this past month in March. That's an 8% jump over February. Takes us to levels that we haven't seen since May of '22.Now, to put that in context, it's still well below the levels that we saw in the meme stocks of 2021, but it might take a while before we see something like that again. So it's in a range where it's starting to show a lot of investor confidence. And I think a lot of that has to stem from the economy showing a firm stance and that it doesn't look like a recession is around the corner.I think you came out of a Q1 where earnings beat expectations fairly handily. Expectations, I think, were a little bit low from the analyst community. But the earnings beat was good. And investors are looking for a couple of factors. We talk about multifactor analysis. Two of the factors that we hear and that we talk about with our investor base quite a bit is positive earnings revisions. So you look at a company like Nvidia that they're the leaders of the pack there.But a couple of other things like free cash flow and then interest coverage ratio, meaning can they are they generating enough profits, revenues, and cash flow to pay off that debt, especially when you're seeing interest rates at these levels? Those are becoming extremely popular factors for our investors to look at.JARED BLIKRE: Well, since we're heading into earnings season right now, let me just ask you on the cusp of earnings season here, so what trends do you think-- you've been putting out this survey or basically you've been gathering these statistics for some time. Do they say anything about what we should expect for the current earnings season?JOE MAZZOLA: Well, I think one of the things to expect when we're looking at the sectors that were purchased in March, IT was a clear favorite. I mean, way above some of the other sectors. But we did see some net buying in health, and we did see some net buying and utilities and materials back in February.And those turned out to be prescient buys, kind of given what they did in the month of March. So it's really staples, health care, and IT for March were the biggest inflows. We did see some inflows in fixed income as well too. Now, I will say this. I think that relative to maybe Q4 earnings that came out in January and February, Q1 earnings, the bar's a little bit higher.We're not seeing the analyst community kind of lower the bar to the same extent that they did for the last quarter. So the bar is set a bit high. We'll get a better indication of that kicking off this Friday with a lot of the financial names. But I think it's kind of put up or shut up time right now for the market kind of given some of the valuations.SEANA SMITH: So put up or shut up time right now for the market. Joe, real quick, let's talk about some of the activity that we've seen or interest, I should say, in some of those traditional meme names, the volatility that we've seen in GameStop, some interest again in AMC. And then you put Reddit into that category following its IPO. Did that at all show up in your index and some of the activity? And if not, I guess, what does that tell us just in terms of the split that we're seeing between the retail investor versus what we're seeing on the sell side?JOE MAZZOLA: So I think one of the things that I found very interesting when I looked at the net sales number one on the list was Coinbase. So it's a bit of an ancillary play from what you're talking about there. But Bitcoin, with the rally that it had in Q1, Coinbase was up almost 60% before the pullback that we saw in March. And clients trimmed into that.And I think one of the big differences, like I said, between this time right now, we even seeing that 8% bump in the STAX relative to maybe 2021 is clients are more discerning when it comes to some of those SPAC names and they're a bit more discerning when it comes to the meme names. I think if you go back to 2022, yeah, look, they got burned a little bit on those names. And they're not they're not scooping them at the same levels that we maybe saw them in the past.JARED BLIKRE: All right. We've got to leave it there, but really appreciate your insights.

2024-04-09 15:05:00,Apple changes App Store rules to allow retro game emulators globally,"Apple updated its App Store rules Friday to allow emulators for retro console games globally with an option for downloading titles. However, the company warned that the developers are responsible for making sure that they follow copyright rules.Android users can already access a ton of emulators to play old classics on their devices. Apple's update will probably encourage some of those developers to bring their emulators to the App Store.The company stated that these emulator apps must use an in-app purchase mechanism to offer digital items. With Apple having to tweak App Store rules because of regulations, these kinds of games would provide another revenue stream for the company.In January, when Apple released the first set of rules in compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules, the company also announced that it would allow streaming game stores globally. Plus, it updated App Store rules at that time to support in-app purchases for mini-games and AI chatbots.Apple also updated the clause on Friday for offering plug-ins to cover HTLM5-based mini-apps — possibly to include services offered by super apps like WeChat.""Apps may offer certain software that is not embedded in the binary, specifically HTML5 mini apps and mini-games, streaming games, chatbots, and plug-ins. Additionally, retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games,"" the clause said. Last month, when the U.S. Department of Justice sued Apple, suppression of super apps was one of the five points in the lawsuit about the company's monopolistic practices.Another major upgrade to the rules will allow music streaming services — like Spotify — to display information about subscriptions and other digital buys along with including links to drive users to their website to complete the purchase.Last month, Spotify submitted an update in the App Store to show pricing information to EU-based users.The music streaming platform said that Apple still hasn't approved its submission. Spotify said that it is still reviewing Apple's updated rules.""Following the law is not optional, but Apple continues to defy that decision. Effective April 6th, the Commission can start noncompliance proceedings and impose daily fines.

Despite its size, Fisher Asset Management has notched some impressive gains over the past decade. The firm’s 10-year annual returns are north of 58%, while over the last five years, Fisher returned 63%. In just the last 12 months he is up to 24%.Although he has a large portfolio containing well over 900 companies, these are the three stocks dominating this investing icon’s portfolio today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Daniel Fung / ShutterstockAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently slipped to fifth place as the most valuable company in Fisher’s portfolio, but its performance so far this year has been stellar. AMZN stock is up 20% year to date and more than 76% higher over the past year.Because the online retailer is so integral to the economy, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It’s not just because of its e-commerce platform but also its cloud services business, which provides the backbone for the internet presence of numerous companies. And it continues to improve itself.Cost-cutting measures and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are paying benefits to Amazon. Strong revenue and better profit margins over the past few quarters are just some of the tangible results of its efforts. Perhaps most notable is the surge in advertising revenue, up 27% last quarter to $14.7 billion. It is already the third-largest ad platform behind Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).Fisher owns 41.8 million shares of Amazon stock worth $7.6 billion, making it the fourth-largest position in his portfolio at 3.7% of the total. With an average purchase price of around $54 per share, Fisher has seen his investment more than triple in value.Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest position Fisher owns. It represents 5% of his portfolio. Few stocks are as closely associated with AI as Microsoft. Having integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI technology into all aspects of its operations, the tech giant is receiving significant dividends.AI contributed 600 basis points of growth to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services business last quarter, double what it had done just one quarter prior. It is also helping Microsoft land more and bigger deals for longer contractual periods of time.Clients like Azure. It allows them to grow their transition to the cloud at their own pace. The hybrid environment lets them choose the level of service they want and where they want it. They can choose between on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both. Expect to see AI’s growth rate and contribution to Microsoft accelerate in the coming quarters.Fisher owns 25.4 million shares of MSFT stock worth $10.7 billion. He’s generated gains of 291% so far with his average purchase price of $107 per share.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comThe No. two holding in Fisher Asset Management is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite all the headwinds the consumer electronics stock faces, Apple has tripled Fisher’s investment from the average buy-in price of $51 per share. Yet the headwinds are legion.Most notable is the Justice Dept. suing Apple for antitrust violations. Although some of the allegations seem ludicrous, such as operating a monopoly when it has but a 57% share of the domestic smartphone market, it will be a distraction for management as it fights back against the charges.Apple also has its work cut out for it in China, one of its biggest markets but also one that has seen sales slow dramatically. Its iPhone sales reportedly plummeted 33% in China in January and February, according to Bloomberg News. Of course, March tends to be the strongest month of the three in the quarter, so we will need to see how the iPhone fared then.The consumer tech leader has its next iteration of the smartphone coming out later this year. The iPhone 16 should also have some form of Google’s own AI technology accessible so it could be a big seller.Apple stock is down 9% year-to-date, but no one suggests the party is over by a long shot.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-04-05 15:30:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Bolsters Pixel Watch Series With Latest Move,"Alphabet’s GOOGL Google recently unveiled new features and updates for its Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 series.This includes a new ""Vibration watch"" feature, allowing users to tap their watch face with two fingers to receive time as a series of haptic vibrations, with two vibration types: Digits and Terse.Further, Google brings auto-brightness improvement to the Pixel Watch series, enhancing the user's experience by allowing them to easily distinguish between different levels of brightness.Alphabet is expected to gain solid traction across smartwatch users on the back of its latest move.Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteApart from the latest updates, the first-generation Pixel Watch now features a new Fitbit Workout UI, replacing the cramped layout of the previous version. The updated layout places key stats in a list that can be swiped up/down, making it more glanceable during exercise.Further, Google upgraded the Pixel Camera app on Wear OS, which now allows users to switch between various photo and video modes on their Pixel Watch, including Night Sight, Portrait, Photo, Video, Slow Motion and Time Lapse, directly from the Pixel Watch's hamburger button.All the above-mentioned endeavors will enable the company to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global smartwatch market. Per a Fortune Business Insights report, the global smartwatch market is anticipated to reach $77.22 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 14.8% between 2023 and 2030.Moreover, strengthening the Pixel Watch series will likely aid Alphabet to bolster its Google Services segment, which remains a key growth driver for the company. Its shares have rallied 46.6% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 43.7%.The strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.52 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.Alphabet’s growing efforts to strengthen the Pixel Watch series are likely to intensify competition for other incumbents like Apple AAPL and Garmin GRMN, which are leaving no stone unturned to expand their footprint in the smartwatch market.Notably, Apple introduced a double tap gesture for the Series 9 and Ultra 2 with watchOS 10.1, allowing users to control the devices with just one hand without touching the display and complementing existing gestures like tap, swipe, raise and cover.Apple’s growing smartwatch offerings increase its adoption rate among smartwatch users, solidifying its position as a market leader in the smartwatch space.

2024-04-05 15:24:00,"Tesla, Apple off to rocky 2024 start. Could things get worse?","The Magnificent 7 member stocks Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) have had a rocky start to 2024, to say the least. Tesla shares have fallen over 30% year-to-date, faced recall problems, and many investors have grown weary of outspoken CEO Elon Musk.Similarly, Apple stock has fallen almost 12% year-to-date while facing multiple downgrades from financial firms and several lawsuits from regulatory agencies.Yahoo Finance Reporters Pras Subramanian and Dan Howley join Yahoo Finance to break down how Tesla and Apple have had such a shaky beginning to the year and how they may operate going forward.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Stocks are climbing higher this morning, snapping the losses that we saw to kick off the second quarter. The S&P 500 had its best start to the year for the first quarter since 2019, up almost 10% since January 1. Meanwhile, though, there's two large tech companies, Apple and Tesla, that have lagged far behind.To help us break down what went wrong with these two companies and what that tells us here about what's to come in the coming quarter, we've got team coverage for you. Pras Subramanian, Dan Howley here to break it all down for us. Let's start with you.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Seana, yeah, so we focused a lot on Tesla this week with the EV company missing Q1 deliveries by about 46,000 vehicles and 8.5% drop from last year. But Tesla's problems didn't just begin this week. So far this year, the stock is down over 30% with interest rates remaining high, many consumers are opting not to purchase big ticket items especially with the company slow to spruce up their aging models.Adding in competitors like China rolling out cheaper EV options and you can start to see why deliveries are down globally. On top of all this, Tesla is currently dealing with an image problem. Many investors have found CEO Elon Musk's attitude and statements to be volatile to say the least. And a litany of investigations related to Tesla's self-driving systems have made the product less appealing to consumers.Now, investors are looking to that first quarter report on April 23 for some signs of upside. Dan, I know you've been watching Apple. What's going on over there with them in Cupertino?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, it has not been a great 2024 for Apple stock so far. It's down almost 12% from the beginning of the year. There's been a few factors that have caused this. It all started at the beginning of the year when three big stock downgrades kicked everything off. Barclays, Piper Sandler, and then Redburn Atlantic all cutting the company within the first 10 days of 2024 on fears of slowing iPhone sales and the potential for regulatory headwinds. We'll get there in just one second.Then just over a week later, the tech giant was forced to sell a modified version of its latest Apple Watches because of a patent dispute that was over that blood oxygen sensor. Apple then kicked off February with disappointing first quarter results with sales in China down 13% compared to the year prior and forecasting a 5% drop in revenue for its upcoming second quarter. By the end of February, Bloomberg reported that Apple ditched its EV project that had been speculating for 10 years. So sayonara to that.In March, on the 4th, the EU slapped Apple with a $2 billion fine over its App Store practices. And then on March 21, Apple got hit with an antitrust suit from the Department of Justice, alleging the tech giant monopolized the smartphone market. Now, we're getting reports that Apple is exploring home robot technology. Investors will be looking out to see how the company is looking to innovate.

2024-04-05 15:22:00,Apple’s electric car loss could be home robotics’ gain,"For every tech success story, there are countless projects that slam headlong into the brick wall of reality. Apple’s electric vehicle ambitions are one of the most recent -- and, frankly, best -- examples of a project failing in spite of seeming to have everything going for it.The jury is still out on the ultimate fate of the Vision Pro, but at the very least, Apple’s mixed reality headset demonstrates that the company isn’t afraid to keep trying where pretty much everyone else has failed. With the Apple Car firmly in the rearview, the company is reportedly exploring yet another notoriously difficult path: home robots.The category is both unique and uniquely difficult for a number of reasons. One thing that sets it apart from other categories is the fact that there’s been precisely one success story: the robot vacuum. It’s been 22 years since the first Roomba was introduced, and for the past two decades, an entire industry (including iRobot itself) has been chasing that success.iRobot’s inability to strike gold a second time is not for lack of trying. In the nearly quarter-century since it introduced Roomba, it’s given us gutter clearers, pool cleaners, lawn mowers and even a Roomba specifically designed to remove screws and other hardware detritus off garage floors. In spite of those efforts, however, the company has fared best when it focused its resources back into its robot vacuum.Image Credits: iRobotThe robot vacuum succeeded for the same reason any robot has ever succeeded: It was a product built to perform a single in-demand task repetitively to the best of its ability. To this day, vacuums are the battlefield on which the home robot wars are fought. Take the well-funded Bay Area startup Matic. The former Google/Nest engineers who founded the company believe the next breakthrough in the home will be built on the foundation of robot vacuums. Their case, in part, is that iRobot effectively painted itself into a corner with its puck-like form factor.Those early Roombas weren’t built with today’s sensing and mapping capabilities in mind. Matic believes that by simply making the robot taller, you dramatically improve its vantage point. This was also the driver behind the most interesting innovation found on Amazon’s Astro home robot: the periscope camera.Image Credits: AmazonThe fact is that home robot functionality is severely hampered by form factor. The hockey puck design that’s prevalent across robot vacuums isn’t ideal for anything beyond the core functionality it's built for. To effectively perform more of the sorts of tasks people might desire in a home robot, the hardware needs to get more complex. Mobile manipulators are a great moving target. That is to say, if you want a helping hand, a hand is a good place to start.Like so many other things in this world, however, mobile manipulators are deceptively difficult. In fact, industrial robotics haven’t cracked it yet. Big, bolted-down arms are common in manufacturing, and wheeled autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) like Locus and Kiva are common in warehouses, but the middle ground between the two hasn’t been firmly established. This is a big part of the reason the human element remains important in that world. It’s a problem that will be solved soon enough, but it seems likely it will happen with these more expensive industrial machines well before it makes its way into more affordable home robots (as a rule, corporations generally have deeper pockets than people).This is also a big part of the reason many are championing the humanoid form factor in the workplace (human beings, after all, offer a kind of mobile manipulation). But that’s a longwinded think piece for another day.Image Credits: Hello RoboticsMobile manipulation isn’t entirely out of reach for home robots. Hello Robot’s Stretch is probably the most compelling example at the moment. Rather than a humanoid form factor, the robot looks like a Roomba with a pole mounted in its center. This houses both an imaging system and an arm that moves up and down to clasp objects (dishes, laundry) at different heights. Of course, some tasks are more easily accomplished with two arms -- and suddenly you start to see why so many robotics firms have effectively backward-engineered humanoids.In its current form, Stretch is prohibitively expensive at $24,950. That’s likely a big part of the reason the company is selling it as a development platform. Interestingly, Matic sees its own robot as a kind of development platform -- using vacuuming as a gateway into additional home chores.Another issue with Stretch is that it’s teleoperated (the company sent us a note after this published stating that some developers have created autonomous functions). There’s nothing wrong with teleop in many scenarios, but it seems unlikely that people are going to flock to a home robot that’s being controlled by a human somewhere far away.Navigation is another key barrier to the home. Compared to warehouses and factories, homes are relatively unstructured environments. They differ greatly from one to another, lighting tends to be all over the place and humans are constantly moving stuff around and dropping things on the floor.Matic's vacuum uses an array of cameras to map spaces -- and understand where it is in them. Image Credits: MaticThe world of self-driving has faced its own obstacles on this front. But the key difference between an autonomous robot on the highway and another in the home is that the worst the latter is probably going to do is knock something off a shelf. That’s bad, but very rarely does it result in death. With self-driving cars, on the other hand, any accident represents a significant step back for the industry. The technology is -- perhaps understandably -- being held to a higher standard than its human counterpart.While adoption of self-driving technologies is well behind the curve that many anticipated, largely for the above safety reason, many of the technologies developed for the category have helped quietly kickstart their own robotics revolution, as autonomous vehicles take over farms and sidewalks.This is likely a big part of the reason it might view home robots as “the next big thing” (to quote Bloomberg quoting its sources). Apple has no doubt pumped a tremendous amount of resources into driving technologies. If those could be repurposed for a different project, maybe it won’t all be for naught.While the reports note that Apple “hasn’t committed” to either the robotic smart screen or mobile robot that are said to exist somewhere inside the company’s skunkworks, it has already put Apple Home execs Matt Costello and Brian Lynch on the hardware side of things, while SVP of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea is said to be involved on the AI side of things.Image Credits: Brian HeaterGiven the proximity to its home efforts, one can imagine the company working on its own version of Amazon’s Astro -- though that project currently exists as more of a cautionary tale for the time being. The project has been hamstrung by high cost and a lack of useful features to justify it. The system also effectively served as a mobile Alexa portal, and home assistants have largely fallen out of fashion of late.Apple does have some robotics expertise -- though nothing approaching what Amazon has on its industrial side. The company has been involved in the production of robot arms like Daisy, which salvages key metals from discarded iPhones. That’s still a pretty large leap to a home robot.Perhaps the company could take a more Vision Pro-like approach to the category, which has a heavy focus on developer contributions. Doing so, however, would require an extremely versatile hardware platform, which would almost certainly be cost-prohibitive for most consumers, making the Vision Pro’s $3,500 price tag look like small potatoes.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/apples-electric-car-loss-could-be-home-robotics-gain/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-electric-car-loss-could-222232498.html,AAPL,0.132,0.062,0.8059999999999999,0.9986,Positive,171.091796875,169.3000030517578,-1.0472704454388748,-1

2024-04-04 14:36:00,"Dan Ives Just Said Microsoft's ""iPhone Moment"" Is Here. Here's What That Means.","Chatter surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated the technology sector for over a year now. Big tech is leading the charge in the AI revolution, but one company in particular could be separating from the pack.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a major investor in OpenAI, the home of ChatGPT. The Windows developer has swiftly integrated OpenAI's features across its ecosystem, and one Wall Street analyst is sounding the alarm.Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to proclaim that Microsoft's ""iPhone moment"" has arrived.Apple is one of the most recognized brands around the world. The company completely disrupted personal computing and music streaming with the introduction of the iMac and iPod.But perhaps Apple's greatest achievement was its foray into mobile communications. The iPhone is undoubtedly one of the most successful devices ever released. While Apple was already known for its innovation, the iPhone put Apple in the driver's seat among consumer electronics businesses.For years, Microsoft was known for its Windows operating system. Moreover, a series of acquisitions primarily under former CEO Steve Ballmer helped create the illusion that Microsoft was evolving into a more ubiquitous platform. However, investors eventually soured on this narrative -- leaving some to question where Microsoft was headed.Ballmer's successor, Satya Nadella, has been at Microsoft's helm since 2014. Over the last decade, Nadella has transformed Microsoft into a major player in cloud computing. But with fierce competitors such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, the cloud narrative needed a new chapter.In January 2023, Microsoft made waves after it announced a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI. While this may have been no more than an intriguing headline for some, Microsoft quickly made it clear that it was going all in on AI.One of the core new services Microsoft is marketing as part of its AI campaign is called CoPilot. While the product is fairly new, Microsoft's big bet on AI appears to be paying off in spades.Per the company's most recent earnings call, CoPilot is seeing success in many areas across Microsoft's ecosystem. For example, the company's developer platform, GitHub, has 1.3 million CoPilot subscribers. This has led to a 40% annual increase in GitHub revenue, as of Dec. 31.Moreover, CoPilot can integrate with apps offered by leading enterprise software platforms such as ServiceNow and Salesforce.Microsoft's most lucrative opportunity related to AI may reside in its Azure cloud suite. Although the company's cloud platform was already performing at a respectable level, integrating ChatGPT into Azure has led to a new wave of growth. In fact, the reinvention of Azure had Nadella boasting that Microsoft has ""moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.""Ives currently has a price target of $500 for Microsoft stock, implying about 19% upside as of market close on March 29.While this is encouraging, I am more intrigued by Nadella's statement. Both Amazon and Alphabet are also looking to leverage AI to bolster their respective cloud businesses. But Microsoft may have the edge in this regard.It's still early days for ChatGPT and its development. And yet, in about a year's time, Microsoft has already generated impressive returns from the partnership. But at 36 times forward earnings, Microsoft stock is by no means cheap. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of the S&P 500 is currently 20.7.Nevertheless, I think Microsoft's premium valuation is warranted. The company is emerging as one of the leaders of the AI realm, and I agree with Ives' position that the company's ""iPhone moment"" is here. AI represents an important new chapter for Microsoft, and I am optimistic that the company can keep its momentum up.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cramer said that the latest market decline was not ""consequential"" because if the upcoming jobs report comes in weaker than expected, the market will rebound as people would expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to avoid a hard landing. Cramer said it's been a while since we saw a broader selloff, so we ""forgot"" how to ""handle"" one.The CNBC host tried to get to the ""real reasons"" behind the latest selloff and found them in earnings, which he said are always important for him. Cramer first talked about payroll solutions company Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) which recently posted downbeat sales for the fiscal third quarter ending February 29, 2024. Cramer specifically highlighted Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) CEO comments delivered during the company's latest earnings call where he talked about some trends he's seeing in the jobs market.""But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now.Our clients tell us they still can’t find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients."" [read the full earnings call transcript here.]Cramer then turned to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which he believes does not deserve to be in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks anymore. Cramer said that the problems Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing have to do with the overall declining demand for EVs in the US. He said Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing what Ford and GM had already faced.Cramer said that the ""real problem"" with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is that it turned out to be a car company instead of an ""immortal tech company."" However, Cramer said Tesla is a ""headline grabber"" and it always will be.Jim Cramer reiterated that we should always expect a 10% pullback on average every two years, based on the analysis of legendary economist Peter Lynch.  He also said that there weren’t ""many"" stocks that saw declines in the latest selloff. Instead, he thinks most of the losses were seen by individual stocks based on specific events and catalysts. Cramer thinks the market was overbought and the selloff was due, and he said it's not over yet. Cramer recommend investors to ""hunker down"" and wait for the markets to rebound.Jim Cramer has been recommending mega-cap quality names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) over the past few months as he's highly bullish on the AI revolution that is boosting several names under his coverage.MethodologyFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few weeks and picked some of the most important stocks he discussed. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, where applicable. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: N/AOn March 26, when Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) was skyrocketing, Cramer said on CNBC that if I were Donald Trump ""this is the moment"" when you'd say it's time to release more shares.""I am not sure where Mr. Trump's head is, but this is a moment where he could say, look, the stock's up 286%. No one would mind if I sold stock, so please let me do it.""Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) shares have pared gains since. The stock is down 26% over the past five days as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) recently revealed that it had a net loss of about $58 million in 2023, while revenue in the period was $4.1 million.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 14Jim Cramer is highly bearish on mortgage residential REIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). A caller recently asked Cramer whether he should buy AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) stock for dividends. Cramer’s reply was a resounding “No.” He asked the questioner to see how the stock has performed over the past few years, or “any period” for that matter. Cramer said this stock “just goes down” and “I don’t want you to touch that stock.” Cramer is bearish on AGNC but recommends buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)  for the long term.As of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). The biggest stakeholder of AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) during this period was Karim Abbadi and Edward Mcbride’s Centiva Capital which owns a $16 million stake in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Water handling and recycling solutions company Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about recently. Cramer said that he’s a bit late to the stock since Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have “almost doubled.” Cramer said he’d wait for a pullback in the stock price.“Let’s see if we can get it back to $10.”Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have gained about 64% so far this year.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 29Texas-based software company Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) stock is a Buy, according to Jim Cramer. When asked about the stock, Cramer said that it's a very ""well-run"" company. He also said that a government business is a ""good business.""Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) is one of the stocks seeing heavy insider selling activity this year. John S Marr Jr, Tyler Technologies Inc's (NYSE:TYL) former CEO and current executive chairman of the board, sold 7,500 shares of Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) on March 13 at $425.07 per share.Here is what Andvari Associates has to say about Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:TYL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:“After good results for the first half of the year, Andvari’s performance suffered at the end of the third quarter for two reasons. First, renewed fears of interest rates remaining higher for longer impacted multiple holdings that are most sensitive to rates. Companies with high growth prospects, like Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL), also declined. A third group also declined: our investments in fixed income and preferred securities for retirement accounts naturally declined in value as the prices of these securities go down when interest rates go up.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 45Jim Cramer is bullish on automated electronic broker platform company Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR). When asked about the stock in a latest program, Cramer said that it’s an “incredibly well-run company” and “everybody feels that way.” In the same vein Jim Cramer also recommended investors to consider buying Charles Schwab shares. In addition to IBKR, Cramer is recommending Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR) shares have gained about 39% over the past one year.TimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. Third quarter’s earnings were above consensus estimates, aided by the combination of higher revenues and lower expenses. Despite the beat, its shares lost -4% due to reduced expectations around inorganic account growth as two new Asian broker relationships have been pushed out.”Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 51Jim Cramer hit the “Buy, Buy, Buy” button on Texas-based construction engineering company Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) during a latest Lightning Round segment of his program Mad Money on CNBC. Cramer said that Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is “just fantastic.” He said Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is a great infrastructure player.“I think you’ve got a winner there.”Artisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Along with DexCom, notable adds in the quarter included Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) and Jabil. Quanta provides outsourced skilled labor for maintenance and construction services, primarily to utilities. We have followed the company for over a decade and have witnessed its shift from oil and gas to renewables. The energy transition (solar and wind farms, electric vehicles, etc.) requires investments in the US energy grid to support greater electrification. At the same time, climate change is increasing stress on the existing grid, forcing utilities to increase maintenance spending. Furthermore, Federal incentive programs, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, will help fuel Quanta’s long-term growth given its expertise in transmission and distribution connections as renewable energy infrastructure seeks to connect to the grid. The stock sold off early in the quarter on concerns that higher interest rates would lead to a pullback in renewables investments by utility customers. However, based on our industry research, we think Quanta’s key customers are well resourced and committed to meeting long-term electrification needs via infrastructure investment. We used the selloff as an opportunity to move the position into the CropSM at a more attractive valuation.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Talking About These 5 Stocks. Suggested Articles:Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsJim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 StocksDisclosure.

2024-04-03 19:00:00,Stock Stinkers: 3 Warren Buffett Holdings Disappointing Investors in 2024,"Through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), Warren Buffett controls a massive portfolio of stocks that is today worth more than $370 billion. The portfolio contains many large and successful positions, some of which Buffett has held for decades. However, the portfolio is not perfectly constructed and contains a fair number of stinkers. Some stocks have been long-term failures while others have recently taken a turn for the worse.Making matters more interesting is that Buffett’s portfolio is fairly narrow given its size and is highly concentrated in a few large bets. This can make the portfolio susceptible to a downturn in a big position. Yet, in his wisdom, Buffett always cautions investors against paying too much attention to short-term fluctuations in the stock market. Rather, says Buffett, investors should focus on gains achieved in a stock over the long term. Here are the stock stinkers in Warren Buffett’s portfolio.Source: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.comLet’s start with Warren Buffett’s largest holding, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). To say the position Berkshire Hathaway holds in AAPL stock is outsized would be an understatement. Currently, Berkshire owns 905.56 million shares of Apple stock worth $153.83 billion. A total of 41.5% of the holding company’s portfolio is comprised of AAPL stock. Berkshire Hathaway is Apple’s largest shareholder outside of mutual fund companies such as Vanguard.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is to say that it’s very bad for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway that AAPL stock is down 8% on the year and badly trailing the market after more than a decade of outperformance. Today, Apple is one of the worst-performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The decline is being blamed on slowing sales of iPhones and other electronic devices, notably in China. An antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department isn’t helping either.While there’s hope that AAPL stock will bounce back, some analysts are pointing to Berkshire Hathaway’s big holding of Apple shares as an example of the risks that come when investors are overly concentrated in one stock.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comEven worse than Apple has been the year-to-date performance of Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). Since the first trading session in January, CHTR stock has plunged 28%. What makes this holding of Warren Buffett’s particularly bad is that it has been a long-term stinker, down 20% over the past five years. Buffett’s stake is relatively small at 3.82 million shares worth $1.09 billion, comprising just 0.3% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. But by most metrics, this has been a losing investment.Buffett surely likes Charter Communications’ position as the biggest cable operator and largest pay TV provider in America. However, CHTR stock has been hurt by the company’s legacy Spectrum internet business unit, which continues to lose market share and money. In its most recent quarter, Charter reported losing 61,000 residential and small business internet customers. Consequently, the company’s profit amounted to $7.07 per share, which was nearly 20% below Wall Street forecasts.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comOne of the absolute worst holdings of Warren Buffett is entertainment giant Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). The stock has performed so badly that it begs the question: why is Buffett still holding onto this stinker? So far in 2024, PARA stock has fallen 19%, bringing its 12-month decline to 47%. Over five years, the company’s share price is down 77%. The company is struggling under high debt levels, an unprofitable streaming service, and a strike by Hollywood actors and writers last year that hurt its production.Paramount Global has let it be known that it’s for sale and is willing to entertain offers. While a few rumors of a potential sale have surfaced, to date no deals have been formally announced, leaving PARA stock in limbo. It might be that Buffett is hanging on in hopes that a sale will be announced and the share price will rise. However, it’s hard to know what Buffett is thinking as he almost never discusses individual stocks in public. He did complain about Paramount Global cutting its dividend at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting.Currently, Berkshire Hathaway owns 63.32 million shares of PARA stock valued at $750.81 million, comprising 0.2% of the portfolio.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL.

2024-04-03 14:52:00,"Target shopper data, streaming TV ads are key to its sales","By Siddharth CavaleNEW YORK (Reuters) - While streaming a favorite TV show as her baby naps, an ad for Enfamil NeuroPro infant formula pops on a new mother's screen.She whips out her phone to scan the ad's ""quick response"" code. It directs her phone to Target's website to complete the $46.49 purchase.Sales of merchandise at Target stores have fallen for three consecutive quarters as Americans seek bargains at rivals Walmart and direct-to-consumer retailers PDD Group's Temu and Shein.Minneapolis-based Target projects its comparable sales will be ho-hum - flat to up 2% - this year.But Target's retail media unit, a business through which it creates and sells ads, grew more than 20% in its fiscal year ended Feb. 3, Target CEO Brian Cornell said during Target's March 5 analyst day in New York.Overall, product makers and other advertisers are expected to spend $60 billion total to advertise on U.S. retailers' media networks in 2024, according to estimates from Emarketer, a market research company. From Walmart to Amazon, and from Macy's to Home Depot, more retailers are betting on revenue from advertising.Target's ad business, which it calls Roundel, generated $1.5 billion in ""value,"" Target's CEO Cornell said, adding that its ad business benefited Target's gross margins more than its revenue.With tech companies like Google tightening their grip on third-party data sharing with advertisers, advertisers are eager to glean insights from retailers like Target, according to representatives from four advertising agencies specializing in consumer goods. Shoppers make more than 250 million visits a year to Target stores and its website.Enfamil and Apple are both among what Cara Sylvester, chief guest experience officer at Target, said was a pool of 2,600 brands that pay Target to craft product advertisements that reach certain Target shoppers, including on social media and streaming platforms.Last year, for instance, Apple partnered with Roundel on a holiday campaign for its Apple Watch Series 9, Sylvester said, adding that the campaign attracted a significantly higher number of new shoppers, many from outside of Target's app and website, than Apple's prior campaigns with Target. Apple confirmed it worked with Target on the ad but declined further comment.And when Enfamil maker Reckitt wanted to reach young parents, Target tapped into its own shopper data to identify an audience of likely buyers. It zeroed in on Target shoppers who either bought baby gear over the previous six months, or NeuroPro formula over the previous year. It then tapped its ongoing partnerships with smart-TV device makers such as Roku Streaming Stick and Fire TV stick to display the ad - with a scan-to-buy QR code - to the target buyer group.Nich Weinheimer, executive vice president of strategy at Skai, a marketing agency whose clients include Philips, Kellogg, and Sony, said advertisers see Target as a prime vehicle for reaching new moms and heads of households who buy household products and clothing and accessories.According to Numerator, a research firm that tracks shopper behavior, Target's shoppers are primarily white and female, live in suburban or urban areas, and have a household income between $40,000 and $125,000.Target doesn't hand over its individual shopper data to its advertising clients, but rather shares aggregated shopper data without personally identifiable information, a Target spokesperson said.Target investor Huntington Private Bank likes Target's profitable ad business, and hopes Target will use the proceeds from advertising sales to lower its prices on the merchandise it sells online and in stores.""Getting more and more into the ad opportunity ... is where the real money is,"" said David Klink, a senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, which holds more than $20 million in Target shares.Enfamil said it spent what it said was a six-figure sum for the advertisement that ran from mid June though the end of July. Target managed the entire campaign, according to a Target case study summarizing the campaign's results.In its summary of the Enfamil campaign, Target said 15.8 million shoppers viewed the ad. Target's strategy of marketing the formula to past baby product purchasers delivered a roughly 31% better return on Enfamil's ad spending than if Target had directed the ad only to past NeuroPro purchasers, according to the case study.Enfamil said it would continue to work with Roundel on more ads in the future.

They had an announcement from their GTC event, where they launched their Blackwell GPU architecture.They saw year-to-date shares up 89%. Over the last 12 months, up 226%. We also had Intel. They got some of the money from the CHIPS Act, finally, $8.5 billion plus some loans in there, that they're able to take advantage of.We also saw Apple, in a good way, kill its electric car project. That was a decade in the making. Seemed to not really be going anywhere. This will allow them to focus more on AI, which is something that, according to Wall Street or according to, I guess, the perception they're severely lacking.And then, finally, we had Meta. They announced that they're going to be providing a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share and authorized additional share buybacks of $50 billion. That sent the stock skyrocketing 38% year-to-date, 131% over the last 12 months.Now, let's get to the fun stuff. This is the bad and the ugly. The bad-- let's kick things off with the FTC. They announced an inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft over investments in AI with Anthropic and OpenAI. Obviously, the FTC trying to make sure that no one firm dominates the still nascent generative AI space.The Digital Markets Act over in the EU, that has the European Commission looking into whether Apple, Google, and Meta are actually complying with that law that basically ensures that big tech players don't dominate their markets.We also had Google with a terrible debut of their Gemini generative image software. The big image that went out there was a--JARED BLIKRE: Missed the mark.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. Missed the mark is what they said. Multicultural Nazis are not a good thing that you want to post on the internet. And that's what ended up happening with Gemini. And then, obviously, we have the TikTok ban that Congress is trying to get through.And then, finally, let's go over some of the very ugly stuff. The first is-- this is heinous. We have the DOJ's Antitrust fight against Apple, basically, saying that they try to block out competition, which harms consumers.We have Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI saying that they've abandoned their original mission for creating AI that benefits humanity in favor of profits. We have Intel, their earnings fell well short with really just blasted them as far as their share price goes.Generally, we've seen a lot of tech layoffs continue. And then this EV demand slowdown that we're seeing, where people just aren't taking up EVs as fast as anybody really thought that they would or wanted to. And so that's really hurting things. And we see that with Tesla coming in with their announcement.So look, it's been a wild quarter. I think that the main story, the main takeaway is still NVIDIA. They're the big leaders. But look, Apple getting play all over the place as they usually do in both the good and bad side.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. And I've heard their own offerings competitors to OpenAI really gaining traction in the marketplace and also in some of these benchmark tests.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/q1s-big-tech-trends-good-144109918.html,AAPL,0.085,0.083,0.8320000000000001,-0.4317,Neutral,168.9219970703125,170.4398956298828,0.8985795727589573,1
2024-04-03 14:36:00,Apple Investors Seek Signs Worst Is Over After Quarterly Slump,"(Bloomberg) — With Apple Inc.’s stock coming off its poorest quarterly performance relative to the S&P 500 Index in over a decade, traders are looking for signs that the worst may be over.Most Read from BloombergA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger AheadTrump Media’s Business Doesn’t MatterIran Vows to Punish Israel Over Deadly Syria Embassy StrikeErdogan Suffers Historic Loss in Turkey Municipal ElectionsCaribbean Golden Passport Cost Soars to $200,000 on EU CrackdownThe 12% drop since the start of the year paid off for short sellers, giving them an incentive to unwind their bets. Technical analysts say the stock is flirting with levels where dip-buyers are likely to swoop in. And the lagging run may make Apple look cheap compared with the other big tech companies.“Nobody wants to sell anymore of their Apple positions because there’s a dividend, big share buybacks and no one wants to pay capital-gains taxes on it,” said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler & Co. “I don’t see the stock falling much further from here. The bigger risk is that Apple’s stock may be stuck in a range between $165 to $200 until it can decisively break above its longer-term moving averages.”The slide has erased more than $300 billion in market value this year, ceding Apple’s status as the most-valuable US company to Microsoft Corp. The drop was spurred by declining sales in China, regulatory scrutiny of its App store, and mounting concern among investors about its growth outlook.As the S&P 500 gained, Apple’s return lagged it by 21 percentage points in the first quarter, the worst showing by that measure since 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.But the loss has been steep enough that it’s nearing a key support level at $165, the low it hit in October, when the broader market also bottomed out.Apple shares briefly traded for less than $170 at various points in recent sessions. Breaking below that level and holding there could presage a pullback to its October low of $165.67. It ended Monday at $170.03.Short sellers pounced on Apple as peers like Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. kept rallying. Apple is the second-most profitable short position this year at $2.4 billion in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners. That may give them some incentive to unwind the positions, and while the size of open short positions hasn’t changed much, they’re down from levels seen last year.With Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that tech shares may face pressure in the coming months — even with Nvidia’s dominance. The stock continues to set new lows relative to the $260 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, ticker QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. That suggests a momentum divergence has formed in the tech sector versus the broader market, with weakness emerging underneath the surface for growth shares.That said, Apple traditionally serves as a flight-to-safety trade due to its strong business model and cash generation. Despite challenges in China, Apple’s massive buyback plans mean its shares continue to have upside potential for long-term money managers, according to Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments Inc.While anxiety is building over how long the artificial intelligence euphoria can last following Nvidia’s over 80% surge in 2024, Apple shouldn’t be a drag on the S&P 500 unless it breaks its multi-year uptrend from its 2020 lows, according to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.If other tech stocks stumble, Piper’s Johnson says it may even spur a rotation back into Apple.“If traders sell Nvidia, will they buy Apple instead? I hear it constantly from clients,” he said. “Investors love swapping one Magnificent Seven stock for another.”—With assistance from Elena Popina.(Updates with Tuesday trading for Apple)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is BannedFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoEclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-flirts-support-levels-worst-100001839.html,AAPL,0.096,0.095,0.809,0.5964,Positive,168.9499969482422,170.10000610351562,0.6806801870648999,1

2024-04-02 18:10:00,1 Magnificent S&P Dividend Stock Down 12% to Buy and Hold Forever,"When it comes to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ: META), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which one is not like the others? They are all iconic tech companies, sure. But only one of these stocks is actually down year to date (YTD) while the markets regularly breach all-time highs -- Apple.Apple stock is down nearly 12% this year and down 14% from all-time highs, and sentiment appears negative. As shown below, its underperformance against the above high-flyers is even more pronounced over the past year.Apple has several challenges, such as a struggling consumer economy in China and a challenge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. But make no mistake, Apple is still a powerhouse, and the stock may be on sale soon.Apple has endured several challenges recently. The pandemic-era stimulus was a massive boon for consumer electronics, but that stimulus dried up just as inflation started eating into people's budgets. Investors are also focused elsewhere, mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) (just look at the AI stocks in the chart above!), where Apple is a minor player. But the biggest reason is China.China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 and 20% of its operating income. The Chinese economy has struggled much more than the U.S.'s, and Chinese competitors like Huawei are taking market share. Reports are that iPhone sales in China are down 33% in February over last year. This is a hurdle, but buying stock in a terrific company when it is down is typically the best money-making strategy over the long haul.Now that we know some of the challenges, let's look at the other side.Here are three reasons for optimism:Consumer strengthServicesReturn of capital.While iPhone sales are slipping in China, they were up 6% overall last quarter, which was Apple's fiscal first quarter. Total revenue rose just 2%; however, operating income rose 12% -- a sign that margin pressures from inflation are easing. The U.S. consumer is resilient, and consumer sentiment is as high as it has been in nearly three years. The recession many feared is in doubt. Apple is too big to be a high-growth name now, but profits should remain robust.Another reason for Apple's significant increase in operating income is its burgeoning Services segment, which has grown exponentially, as shown below.Services include Apple Pay, iCloud subscriptions, advertising, and others. Last quarter, these sales accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue and had a gross margin of 73%, compared to 39% for product sales. This means that Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream is also its most profitable.Apple is a cash cow that generously rewards shareholders. Last quarter, it generated $40 billion in cash from operations and returned $27 billion to shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. Since fiscal 2020, $432 billion has been returned, amounting to 16% of the total market cap today.Apple uses more cash for buybacks than dividends. Some say the dividend yield, which is under 1%, isn't attractive, but I prefer buybacks. Share buybacks are advantageous because investors aren't taxed on them each year. Instead, they reduce Apple's share count, which raises earnings per share (EPS), and the stock price rises as a result. Apple has nearly doubled the total return of the SPDR S&P 500 Trust since 2020.Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention the recently released Apple Vision Pro. This latest foray into wearables allows users to use apps, browse the net, take and view photos and videos in 3D, and play games on a screen as big or small as the user desires by ""bridging the physical and digital space."" This tech is way over my head, but it is pretty incredible, gives Apple another revenue stream, and is a testament to innovation.Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7, just under its three-year and five-year averages.So, interested investors don't need to rush to accumulate shares. Instead, address Apple's current negative sentiment by buying slowly over time to take advantage of price dips. Many will tell you that staying committed in the long run is rewarding once you own the stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

QuoteApart from the Verification settings feature, Google now enables Google Wallet to import data from confirmation emails, automatically pulling movie tickets and travel boarding passes from Gmail accounts.Alphabet also announced Google Wallet updates to support open-loop payment systems, providing a dedicated page for recent activity and ride history, showing saved fare caps, connected payment methods and network-specific offerings.Additionally, the company has added 44 new banks and credit unions to Google Wallet’s list of over 3,000 banks and credit unions. The additions include local banks, credit unions, and prepaid debit cards.All the above-mentioned endeavors will likely aid Alphabet in capitalizing on growth opportunities present in the global digital wallet market. Per The Business Research Company report, the digital wallet market is expected to hit $47.7 billion in 2024 and reach $97.54 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 19.6% between 2024 and 2033.Moreover, growing Google Wallet efforts will further bolster its Android offerings. This, in turn, will boost its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth catalyst for the company. Its shares have rallied 49.1% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 47.9%.The strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $290.4 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.2%.Growing Google Wallet efforts will aid Alphabet to compete well with some notable industry players like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which are also making strong efforts to boost their presence in the booming digital wallet space.Microsoft is enjoying the growing momentum of its Edge Wallet with new feature updates.Microsoft’s Wallet app update to include the integration of a cryptocurrency wallet, providing real-time updates on cryptocurrency value fluctuations and logging transactions, remains noteworthy.

2024-03-28 14:00:00,Why Apple Is Missing From Berkshire Hathaway's Permanent Holdings List,"Earlier this month, I discussed some key takeaways from Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s 2023 letter to shareholders. One of the main points covered was that the guru added Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and the five Japanese conglomerates to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) permanent holding list. However, he did not express his intention to indefinitely hold Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is currrently the conglomerate's largest holding.Since then, I have been pondering why the tech giant is not a permanent holding for Berkshire Hathaway. In this discussion, I will share my preliminary thoughts on the subject.First of all, if we look at Berkshire Hathaway's history, it is not hard to tell that while Buffett has bought many stocks, he only held a handful of them for more than 10 years. According to Markets Insider, his holding period for the 10 longest-held stocks range from 15 years to 35 years (I added 1 year to the holding period as the article was written in 2023). Of these 10 stocks, Buffett still held some such as BYD (SZSE:002594). However, there are only two stocks that he has explicitly said Berkshire will hold indefinitely, namely Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).Buffett's steadfast commitment to these two companies says a lot about his confidence in the resilience of their business models and growth prospects. This observation raises the question of the distinction between Berkshire's permanent holdings and non-permanent holdings. In order to answer this question, I revisited Buffett and Charlie Munger's four criteria and came up with a similar list for permanent holdings.We all know Buffett and Munger's four criteria for making an investment decision:an understandable businessfavorable long-term economicsable and trustworthy managementa sensible price tagHowever, it's important to clarify that these four filters serve as guidelines for making initial purchase decisions, not for permanent holdings. Obviously, the criteria for permanent holdings are different.In my view, the fundamental distinction between a permanent holding and a non-permanent holding is whether the business requires an able and trustworthy management to maintain its moat. In fact, both Munger and Buffett have often said that it is best to ""invest in a business any fool can run, because someday a fool will."" Compared to understandability and favorable long-term economics, idiot-proof is a much higher standard.As for American Express and Coca-Cola, I am not sure whether the former qualifies as an ""idiot-proof"" business. In my view, the card company is quite complex, which make it more vulnerable to mismanagement. On the other hand, Coca-Cola, with its iconic brands and a widespread distribution network, seems to possess the characteristics of an idiot-proof business.Another possible criterion for a permanent holding is a track record of dividend increases and share repurchases. Coca-Cola has raised its annual cash dividend for 62 consecutive years and its initial share repurchase program began in 1984.Now we can attempt to list Berkshire's criteria for permanent holdings:an understandable businessfavorable long-term economicsidiot-proofa track record of dividend increases and share repurchasesWith the above four criteria, we can evaluate whether Apple qualifies as a permanent holding.First, Apple's products are widely popular and have a loyal customer base. However, it still operates in the tech industry, which is notorious for the constant need for innovation. The dynamic nature of the industry makes it very hard to assess the long-term understandability and moat of the company's business as it must continuously adapt to evolving technologies and consumer preferences to maintain its competitive edge.Second, Apple is most likely not idiot-proof. We can gain valuable insights into this aspect from the company's own history. When Steve Jobs was forced out in the 1980s, then-CEO John Sculley almost led to the company's demise. Apple was reborn after Jobs came back and reinvigorated the business. However, it is noteworthy that Berkshire Hathaway did not invest in the stock during his tenure as CEO. Buffett made the decision to purchase Apple shares years after Jobs' passing, following his observation of Tim Cook's exceptional operational capabilities and astute capital allocation decisions. This clearly indicates that Buffett does not consider Apple's business to be idiot-proof.In terms of capital allocation, according to Apple's investor relation website, the company has been paying out a cash dividend since 1987 and has increased payments in most years. However, its share repurchase program is relatively new as the company only started to repurchase shares in 2012, after Cook's succession to the role of CEO. Interestingly, Buffett said that Jobs refused to buy back shares after consulting with him. This suggests his inability to effectively deploy capital was one of the key reasons why the guru did not invest in Apple during Jobs' tenure. At this point, it is unclear whether Apple can sustain its smart capital allocation strategy after Cook's eventual retirement.The rapid pace of technological advancement and the potential change in capital allocation decisions after Cook's tenure are two major potential hurdles for Apple to remain in Berkshire's portfolio for the very long term. Therefore, while Apple possesses many of the characteristics of a very high-quality business, it is still an unlikely candidate for Berkshire's permanent holdings list.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/why-apple-missing-berkshire-hathaways-140002070.html,AAPL,0.09699999999999999,0.027000000000000003,0.8759999999999999,0.9954,Positive,172.7030029296875,171.3665008544922,-0.7738730957327025,-1
2024-03-28 14:00:00,Apple Just Suffered Its Largest Single-Session Drop in Over 7 Months. Here's What It Means for the Stock,"On March 21, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1%, marking the worst single-session drop since it fell 4.8% on Aug. 4, 2023. The sell-off last August was in response to Apple's fiscal 2023 third-quarter earnings. But this latest sell-off had nothing to do with quarterly financial reports.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Apple for monopolizing smartphone markets. Here's what the DOJ said and why it's yet another piece of bad news weighing Apple down.Big tech companies like Apple are no strangers to antitrust threats. However, as Apple has grown in value, it has become a bigger target.The DOJ's 88-page document is chock-full of helpful context, including how Apple purposely built a system to protect itself from competition. ""If you read our lawsuit, what you'll see is that our concerns are not necessarily with what Apple is doing with Apple's products; our concerns are with restrictions when Apple tells others what they can and can't do with their products. That is our primary area of concern and that is the primary area of focus in our lawsuit,"" said Jonathan Kanter, assistant general for antitrust, in an interview with CNBC on March 22.To quote the seventh point from the DOJ's report:Apple's smartphone business model, at its core, is one that invites as many participants, including iPhone users and third-party developers, to join its platform as possible while using contractual terms to force these participants to pay substantial fees. At the same time, Apple restricts its platform participants' ability to negotiate or compete down its fees through alternative app stores, in-app payment processors, and more.Whether you agree or disagree with the suit, the danger is that it targets Apple's high-margin services segment, which has been the saving grace of an otherwise low-growth period for Apple.Apple has expanded its services offering to fuel growth despite sluggish product sales. The company still relies heavily on selling devices -- particularly iPhones. But the business model is still effective as long as Apple is adding users across devices and boosting engagement with services to enhance the Apple ecosystem. Services include iCloud, Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple Podcasts, Apple Pay, and more.For its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30, 2023), Apple reported 11.3% year-over-year growth in services revenue but just a 0.1% increase in products revenue. The high-margin services segment contributed to all-time-high diluted earnings per share and a 10-year high quarterly gross margin of 45.9%.Despite the strength of its services, Apple would be nothing without app developers. Just imagine if Meta Platforms' Instagram wasn't on the iPhone. This absence would degrade the utility of an iPhone, but because of Apple's dominance, it would be even worse for Meta Platforms.Apple's best argument is that developers need Apple more than Apple needs them. But overall, Apple can't succeed without third-party developers. There are valid points that Apple is overcharging for its services. A good example is Apple Pay. To quote the DOJ report:Apple also uses its smartphone monopoly to extract payments from banks, which need to access customers that use digital wallets on iPhones. Since Apple first launched Apple Pay -- long before it achieved meaningful adoption -- Apple has charged issuing banks 15 basis points (0.15 percent) for each credit card transaction mediated by Apple Pay. Payment apps from Samsung and [Alphabet] Google are free to issuing banks. Apple's fees are a significant expense for issuing banks and cut into funding for features and benefits that banks might otherwise offer smartphone users. The volume of impacted transactions is large and growing.In some ways, Apple is a victim of its own success, but that's the nature of antitrust suits. Apple provides more value to its users than ever before, but it will continue to face scrutiny the more it enters new industries like mobile payments.The DOJ lawsuit is yet another thorn in Apple's side, especially because it targets the highest growth segment of Apple's business. The lawsuit doesn't break the investment thesis. Still, it could eventually lead to margin compression for Apple.Apple's other key issues right now include slowing global growth, particularly in China. Apple has also failed to make a splash in artificial intelligence and has largely missed out on the gains that have rippled throughout the tech industry as a result of that theme.If Apple stock were crushing the market and expensive, then there would be cause for concern, but that simply isn't the case.Apple is down over 11% year to date compared to a 9% rally in the Nasdaq Composite -- a substantial underperformance considering Apple is the second-largest component in the Nasdaq behind Microsoft. Zoom out further, and Apple is down over the past six months and up less than 10% over the last year.Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now just 26.6, a discount to the S&P 500's multiple of 28.4. Apple has its challenges, but it's too good of a company to have a lower valuation than the broad market.Given its challenges, Apple stock could remain pressured in the short term, so there's no rush to dive headfirst into the stock. However, Apple has the qualities of an excellent long-term investment for patient investors, so it's worth opening a starter position, holding, or at the very least, adding to the top of your watch list.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

It’s going to be Absolutely Incredible! pic.twitter.com/YIln5972ZD— Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) March 26, 2024https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.jsAs the name ""D"" in WWDC suggests, the event is heavily focused on developers for Apple's various operating systems. The event, which has most recently been held at the Steve Jobs Theater on the company's Cupertino campus, features several days of panels and workshops focused on its various ecosystems. The event also serves as a launching pad for said ecosystems. Anticipate big announcements around iOS and iPadOS 18, macOS 15 and watchOS 11, among others.Seeing as how this year's show will mark one year since the Vision Pro was announced, I would anticipate a LOT of new developers around the headset and its visionOS operating system. Updates to Apple Silicon and, perhaps, new Macs seem pretty likely as well.But Apple's AI plans will almost certainly take center stage at the show this time out. Responding to questions about the company's plans to catch up with generative AI offerings from top competitors like Microsoft and Google on its most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook promised “groundbreaking innovation” set to be announced later this year. WWDC seems like the most likely platform for such an announcement -- and, perhaps, details on a rumored Google Gemini partnership for the iPhone.Joz's sneaky backronym will no doubt only further speculation.Additional rumors have pointed to iOS 18 potentially being ""the biggest"" update in the operating system's long history. Rather than simply leaning into generative AI and being done with it, however, reports point to ""AI tools that help manage your daily life.""Certainly the notion of the AI smartphone isn't Apple specific. Samsung leaned heavily into the concept earlier this year with the launch of its Galaxy S24 line, which also relied on Google's Gemini efforts. The following month, Apple claimed that the new M3-powered MacBook Airs are the “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI,"" mostly due to the neural processing units included in its first-party SoCs.Apple adds, ""Developers and students will have the opportunity to celebrate in person at a special event at Apple Park on opening day."" This is likely a reference to the news-filled keynote that traditionally kicks off the show. Of course, things remain dramatically scaled down since the pre-pandemic days at the San Jose Convention Center.As ever, the event will include a small cohort of ""winners,"" 50 of whom will be invited to the in-person event in Cupertino. The event follows soon after Google I/O (May 14-15) and Microsoft Build (May 21-24).The announcement arrives less than a week after the Department of Justice announced that it is suing the hardware giant over claims of monopolistic practices surrounding the iPhone.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/apple-wwdc-2024-set-for-june-10-14-promises-to-be-absolutely-incredible/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-wwdc-2024-set-june-171745379.html,AAPL,0.10099999999999999,0.006999999999999999,0.892,0.9931,Positive,170.50999450683594,172.72250366210938,1.297583265821251,1

The company is reportedly interested in licensing and building Google’s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features.As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race.Apple researchers also recently said they’ve developed a family of multimodal models — which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time — called MM1.

The opening day announcements will take place in-person at the company’s campus in Cupertino, California.Apple is expected to unveil its next major software updates for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro headset and smartwatch — and its new AI strategy will be front and center for the planned iOS 18 upgrade.In announcing the event, Apple marketing executive Greg Joswiak said, “It’s going to be Absolutely Incredible” — a clear nod to AI.Apple’s artificial intelligence strategy will include a slew of new proactive features to assist users in their daily lives. The company isn’t planning to debut its own generative AI chatbot, though. Instead, Apple is holding talks with potential partners like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and OpenAI to supply generative AI services, Bloomberg News has reported.The iOS 18 update is expected to be the most ambitious overhaul of the iPhone’s software in its history, according to people working on the upgrade. The company is also planning a minor refresh of the Apple Watch’s software and the first major update to the operating system running on the Vision Pro headset.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are ThrivingAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon ValleyTesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-set-unveil-ai-strategy-172610515.html,AAPL,0.098,0.04,0.862,0.9552,Positive,170.91400146484375,172.3800048828125,0.8577433126625967,1

2024-03-27 14:51:00,iPhone shipments declined by 33% in China in February,"According to figures reported by China's government and cited by Bloomberg, Apple (AAPL) iPhone shipments have fallen around 33% in the month of February. The data comes as the company has met waning demand from the region, failing to maintain a competitive edge over Chinese smartphone manufacturers.Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the latest developments on Apple's performance in China.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino[AUDIO LOGO]- Well, China's lost its taste for Apple. That's at least according to new data analyzed by Bloomberg that shows iPhone shipments to China have fallen by a third compared to last year. Now Apple's been facing a number of issues in the country as it sees continued demand and low demand-- continued in low demand for its flagship device and its most important overseas market.That's not the only headwind it's facing. Dan Howley is here with more. And Dan, of course, we've got the bans in place for some of the government agencies. How much of that is leading to the declines we're seeing in iPhone shipments there?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, it's hard to tell exactly, right? Those are limited to two government agencies. And, you know, there's far more consumers that would be able to buy iPhones than just government employees. But that 33% year-over-year decline, that's according to Bloomberg citing Chinese government data, is really stark.We had counterpoint research in the earlier part of this month saying that sales fell 24% in China for the first six weeks of 2024. Overall, smartphone shipments, though, it's worth pointing out, declined in China's 7% during the same period. So it's not just that Apple was declining, it's that other smartphone makers were declining.And then it's also important to point out that there was a large jump in sales around the same time last year because of pent-up demand during the end of 2022. And so it's a number of factors, but it's not looking very good as far as Apple goes, especially with the softer economy in China. We did see Huawei tick up pretty high. But again, that's because they were basically on death's door because of the US chip bans until they managed to get their own chips in place and start selling again.But it really-- it behooves Apple to get this under control. Obviously, they're aware of that. Tim Cook was there earlier this week going to the opening of the new flagship store in Shanghai and then meeting with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to join other tech leaders in ensuring they're kind of positioning in the country.But overall, I mean, you look at a number like this of 33%, and then you look at the antitrust battle that you guys were just talking about, you look at the new potential investigation that the EU is launching as far as the Digital Markets Act against Apple as well as other major tech players. You match that up with the earlier part of this year, where we saw issues with the Apple Watch and the company having to take the blood oxygen sensor out of that. And it really is just this compounding number of problems that the company seems to be facing at this point.They just announced their WWDC event for June 10th. We're expected to see at least some kind of generative AI announcement. That's something that they've been woefully behind in. And that could prove to be a catalyst for them. But, you know, for a company that was riding high for so long, it's not doing poorly, by the way, still one of the richest companies in the world. But it's fallen behind Microsoft. And its stock has not been doing well so far this year. It's down more than 7% year-to-date and up just 6.25% over the last 12 months.You look at Microsoft, you look at Google, they're doing a heck of a lot better.JOSH LIPTON: Dan Howley, thank you, sir.

Apple accounts for the vast majority of those shipments, as the only overseas player with a meaningful market share. The February decline marks a second consecutive month of lower shipments. In January, the company shipped a total of roughly 5.5 million units, or about 39% fewer handsets than in the prior year, according to China Academy of Information and Communications Technology figures.The shares dropped less than 1% in New York on Tuesday morning. They have declined about 12% so far this year, making Apple an outlier among its Big Tech peers.Cupertino, California-based Apple has seen its best-selling product struggle in the world’s biggest smartphone market since the September debut of its latest generation models. The return of Huawei Technologies Co. as a viable rival in the premium phone segment has stolen share away from Apple and the slowdown in iPhone sales prompted rare discounts from the US company in January.Read more: Apple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge“Apple’s retail channels in China are still digesting the shipment from the fourth quarter of 2023, that could explain the drop in recent months,” said Nicole Peng, an analyst at Canalys. “But it’s a sign of a slowing trend for the upcoming months for Apple in China, especially when the Chinese peers are driving very aggressively the AI smartphone messages.”An Apple spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The overall Chinese smartphone market also contracted by almost a third in February, illustrating a wider consumer reluctance to spend on discretionary items. Analysts still predict growth over the course of the year, but they expect iPhone sales to keep deteriorating. Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee said in a note this week that they see the iPhone leading market declines with more than 20% for the year so far.(Updates shares in third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are ThrivingAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon ValleyTesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/iphone-shipments-china-fell-33-124917468.html,AAPL,0.052000000000000005,0.061,0.887,-0.7363,Negative,170.48500061035156,172.39999389648438,1.123262034359014,1

The rules require six designated ""gatekeepers"" that provide services like search engines, social media networks and chat apps to comply with a guidance to level the playing field with their rivals and to give users more choices. Violations of the law could result in fines amounting up to as much as 10% of the companies' global annual turnover.The European Commission's investigation focuses on Google parent Alphabet's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari users, as well as Meta's ""pay or consent model.""The Commission said it ""suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA.""

2024-03-26 18:59:00,"Apple must secure China as it embarks on legal battles in the U.S. and Europe, Wedbush analyst says: ‘Grab the olive branch from Beijing and don’t look back’","There’s troubled waters under the Apple-China bridge. After the company reported weaker sales in the region, its shares dropped 2.9%, wiping $84 billion off its market valuation. In response, CEO Tim Cook doubled down on Apple’s investments in China: He flew to Shanghai last week to be present for its grand opening for a flagship store in Shanghai, and announced plans to launch Apple’s Vision Pro headset in China later this year.It might take more than a new store to calm the waters. Chinese consumers have been shifting their love from the iPhone to domestic smartphone makers—most notably Shenzhen-based Huawei, whose new high-quality line of Mate 60 smartphones has proved to be fierce competition. Now Apple faces falling sales in the region, its third biggest market—and antitrust actions from the U.S and Europe add salt to the wound.Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush, told Fortune “the timing is ironic that Cook is in China while the antitrust issues come from both the US and EU.”“This is a critical time for Apple to grab the olive branch from Beijing and don't look back,” Ives said, adding that “China is key for Apple,” and that the company has struggled to grow there. True enough, Apple’s iPhone sales plummeted 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a Counterpoint Research report. Over that same period, sales for its competitor Huawei surged by 64%.Cook spent several days in China last week—in part to help open the new store, which is Apple’s 57th store in China and the world’s second largest after the one on Fifth Avenue in New York, but he also met with key suppliers, which, according to a note by Wedbush, “was important with worries around a manufacturing supply chain shift out of China into India, Vietnam, and other countries” over the next few years.Ives leaned hopeful: “This trip could start to turn around things in China after a turbulent year.”Turbulent, indeed. Earlier this month, Apple was fined nearly $2 billion by the European Union for anticompetitive music-streaming practices. Apple now faces antitrust actions in the U.S. and Europe—and it’s one of the first to be investigated by the European Union after it passed the Digital Marketing Act, a law implemented in November 2022 that’s aimed at dismantling monopolies and reducing anticompetitive behavior by some of the world’s biggest tech companies.In America, Apple is also at the center of an antitrust lawsuit, filed by the U.S Department of Justice, which alleges Apple’s control of app distribution and programming interfaces suppress technologies like cloud streaming games and cross-platform messaging apps that could otherwise work equally well across different smartphones. Apple said it will defend the claims.The new headwinds, in the form of lawsuit probes, add to the pressure Apple was already facing in China before. Its performance in the region—which accounts for about 20% of its sales, according to the Wedbush note—has been slipping for years. Part of it is because the U.S. and China have been reducing their economic reliance on each other, as seen through a 2019 Trump administration order preventing U.S. tech firms from dealing with Huawei less than two weeks after the Chinese smartphone maker unveiled its trademark Mate 60 Pro phone.In turn, China has invested in its own chips and smartphone parts, while its consumers have used their purchasing power to show solidarity for its domestic smartphone maker. Huawei claimed the second-largest share of the country’s smartphone phone market at 17%, compared to 9% of the share last year, the New York Times reported.To turn things around, Wedbush analysts said Apple will “need to turn around this headwind into a tailwind heading into the iPhone 16 release this Fall and it all starts with reaffirming Apple's presence in China.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-must-secure-china-embarks-185947435.html,AAPL,0.06,0.033,0.907,0.9562,Positive,171.447998046875,170.54319763183594,-0.5277404375358669,-1
2024-03-26 17:35:00,Top 20 Mid-Cap Tech Companies in the US,"In this article, we will list the top 20 mid-cap tech companies in the US. If you want to skip our discussion about the tech industry, visit the Top 7 Mid-Cap Tech Companies in the US. The worldwide expenditure on technology is projected to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. This depicts an expected 7.75% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five years starting in 2022 when the yearly spending on technology was $8,51 trillion. Although the tech industry faced some challenges in 2023, it forged forward and came out strong. The year was also marked by considerable anticipation regarding the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). However, in the year 2024, companies are looking to prioritize AI in their strategies to surpass competitors. This is the year of AI deals and partnerships which could shape the future. It is already being reported that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) for Gemini-powered features on iPhones. Gemini is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google. Moving forward, spending on software and IT services backed by cloud computing and cyber security is expected to dominate the market. Tech companies will continue to experiment with different AI-related applications. In a survey by Deloitte, 52% of tech leaders stated that AI will be the primary technology in 2024. At 47%, an overwhelming proportion of tech leaders also vouched for could computing. In addition, 27% of the respondents were confident that AI will be a game changer for companies in 2024. The United States is at the forefront of global technology and innovation. It sets the pace for advancements in various sectors. The country also has a whopping 36% share of the global information and communication technology (ICT) sector. In addition, the Consumer Technology Association anticipates that retail revenues for the US consumer technology industry will increase by 2.8% in 2024, reaching $512 billion. While the year 2023 came with challenges for the tech sector, there were big gains for leading tech stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), fueled by the AI boom. Analysts believe that tech companies are just getting started with AI innovation. A new era of gains that started with the launch of ChatGPT and generative AI in late 2022 will continue to reap positive results for the tech sector way beyond 2024.AI is also helping small and mid-cap tech companies make their mark by disrupting larger companies. Theia Insights is one of the examples of small companies with the potential to disrupt entire industries with the help of AI. The company claims that it can distill vast amounts of information through AI, and help investors make better decisions. Theia Insights recently also raised $6.5 million. Another AI-related trend in the tech industry is forming partnerships, both within and outside the sector. We have already seen how Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are reported to be in negotiation to integrate generative AI in iPhones. Interestingly, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares went up by 4% following these reports. AI is also compelling tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to partner outside their industry, particularly in the form of vendor and end-user industries collaboration. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) collaborated with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India, to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India. Photo by Campaign Creators on UnsplashTo curate our list of the top 20 mid-cap tech companies in the US, we first proceeded to define Mid-Cap.

2024-03-26 17:28:00,"Apple, Google, Meta targeted under new European law meant to prevent cornering of digital markets","LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators opened investigations into Apple, Google and Meta on Monday, the first cases under a sweeping new law designed to stop Big Tech companies from cornering digital markets.The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm, said it was investigating the companies for “non-compliance” with the Digital Markets Act.The Digital Markets Act that took full effect earlier this month is a broad rulebook that targets Big Tech “gatekeeper” companies providing “core platform services.” Those companies must comply with a set of do’s and don’ts, under threat of hefty financial penalties or even breaking up businesses. The rules have the broad but vague goal of making digital markets “fairer” and “more contestable"" by breaking up closed tech ecosystems that lock consumers into a single company’s products or services.The commission has heard complaints that tech companies' measures to comply have fallen short, European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief, said at a press briefing in Brussels.“Today, we decided to investigate a number of these suspected non-compliance issues. And as we unearth other problems, we will tackle those too.""The decision was met with immediate pushback from industry groups like the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a not-for-profit trade group in Washington that represents tech and communications companies.“The timing of these announcements, while the DMA compliance workshops are still ongoing, makes it look like the Commission could be jumping the gun,"" the group said in a prepared statement. ""Possible outcomes aside, this move risks confirming industry fears that the DMA compliance process might end up being politicized.”The companies have been ordered to hold on to certain documents that the commission can access in current and future investigations, she said.Regulators are looking into whether Google and Apple are fully complying with the DMA's rules requiring tech companies to allow app developers to direct users to cheaper options available outside their app stores. The commission said it's concerned the two companies are imposing “various restrictions and limitations” including charging recurring fees that prevent apps from freely promoting offers.Google is also facing scrutiny for not complying with DMA provisions that prevent tech giants from giving preference to their own services over rivals. The commission said it is concerned Google's measures will result in third-party services listed on Google’s search results page not being treated “in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.”Google said that it has made “significant changes” to the way its services operate in Europe to comply with the DMA.“We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months,” Google's director of competition, Oliver Bethell, said.The commission is also investigating whether Apple is doing enough to allow iPhone users to easily change web browsers.Apple said it's confident that its plan complies with the DMA, and it will “continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations.” The company said it has created a wide range of new developer capabilities, features, and tools to comply with the regulation.The commission is also looking into Meta's option for European users to pay a monthly fee for ad-free versions of Facebook or Instagram, so they can avoid having their personal data used to target them with online ads.“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers,” it said.Meta said it will “engage constructively” with the Commission.""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,” it said in a prepared statement.The commission said it aims to wrap up its investigations within 12 months.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/european-regulators-investigate-apple-google-100850938.html,AAPL,0.07400000000000001,0.059000000000000004,0.867,0.9043,Positive,171.3800048828125,170.86000061035156,-0.30342178646599405,0
2024-03-26 17:05:00,Apple at risk of £30bn fine after EU launches investigation,"Apple, Meta and Google face fines of billions of euros after the European Union opened the first investigations under new laws designed to rein in Big Tech.Margrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton, the EU’s competition and digital markets chiefs, announced five investigations into the three companies on Monday.They concern areas including the companies’ smartphone app stores and Meta charging a monthly fee to users in Europe who do not want to see adverts on Facebook and Instagram.It comes less than three weeks after the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) came into force. The laws are designed to rein in so-called gatekeepers – Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft – which face fines of up to 10pc of their annual revenue for not complying with the law.In Apple’s case, this would be up to $38bn (£30bn), for Google $30.7bn and for Meta $13.4bn.Earlier this month Apple was fined €1.8bn (£1.5bn) for breaking EU competition laws by favouring its own music streaming service over rivals.The investigations concern Google and Apple rules restricting how apps can promote cheaper subscriptions outside of the companies’ app stores, Google promoting its own services in search results, Apple offering alternative web browsers to Safari, and Meta charging a monthly fee for a version of Facebook and Instagram without adverts.The European Commission said the fee, of up to €13 a month, “may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent [to personalised adverts]”.It could mean Meta being forced to offer a version of Instagram and Facebook without personalised adverts for free, which would mark a major challenge to its business model.Mr Breton said: “We are not convinced that the solutions by Alphabet, Apple and Meta respect their obligations for a fairer and more open digital space for European citizens and businesses. Should our investigation conclude that there is lack of full compliance with the DMA, gatekeepers could face heavy fines.”He added that the EU was considering further investigations into Amazon for favouring its own brands in search results, and Apple for rules it imposes on rival iPhone app stores.The investigations show that the EU is seeking to move quickly in enforcing its new laws, after criticism that regulators struggle to keep up with technological changes.Apple said: “We’re confident our plan complies with the DMA, and we’ll continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations.” Google said: “We have made significant changes to the way our services operate in Europe,” adding: ”We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.”Meta defended charging users as an alternative to advertising, saying: “We will continue to engage constructively with the Commission.”Daniel Friedlaender, the European head of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a lobby group that represents the tech industry, criticised opening the investigations while companies are still going through early “workshops” to work out how to comply with the laws.“The timing of these announcements, while the DMA compliance workshops are still ongoing, makes it look like the Commission could be jumping the gun,” he said. “Possible outcomes aside, this move risks confirming industry fears that the DMA compliance process might end up being politicised.”",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-meta-google-under-investigation-123211653.html,AAPL,0.064,0.049,0.887,0.7812,Positive,171.16000366210938,171.2550048828125,0.05550433434826803,0
2024-03-26 16:36:00,Explainer-Why is the EU probing Big Tech under the Digital Markets Act?,"By Martin CoulterLONDON (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday launched investigations into Alphabet, Apple and Meta for potentially breaching a landmark new law designed to prevent Big Tech having an unfair advantage over competitors.Last year, Brussels designated six companies as ""gatekeepers"" under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), meaning they were big and powerful enough to warrant extra regulation: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance.They were given six months, until March 7, to comply with the rules, which aim to open up commonly used popular tech platforms and give users greater choice.Violations could result in fines of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover. The EU Commission hopes to wrap up the probes within a year.Below is a rundown on main areas of the investigation:ANTI-STEERING:Two of the five investigations relate to Alphabet and Apple's payment systems, specifically around ""anti-steering"" behaviour.Whenever you make an in-app purchase on an iPhone or an Android device – such as ordering food for delivery or upgrading to the premium version of Strava – Apple or Alphabet will usually take a cut of the fee.To get around this, app developers sometimes ""steer"" consumers towards their own websites, encouraging them to make payments to them directly so they can swerve the big tech companies' extra charges.Apple has already been accused of anti-steering behaviour.The EU fined the tech giant $2 billion earlier this month over claims it had blocked users of music streaming services from accessing discounts and promotions outside its own payments ecosystem. Brussels' move was cheered by Spotify, which has accused Apple of blocking rivals from sharing perks with their subscribers.Beyond music streaming, the EU is now investigating whether Apple and Google have prevented even more consumers from accessing offers outside their control.SELF-PREFERENCING:In bricks-and-mortar retail, supermarkets sometimes sell cheaper own-brand alternatives on the shelves next to pricier goods.That becomes more complicated with online marketplaces, where tech companies have been accused of displaying their own products more prominently than those of their rivals, giving themselves an unfair competitive edge.Another of the EU's five investigations concerns whether Google prioritises its own services – such as Google Hotels or Google Flights – when users type queries into its search engine, potentially limiting business for rivals such as Booking.com or Skyscanner.The EU said on Monday it was also looking into whether Amazon was giving preference to its own products in its online store over rivals, but stopped short of launching an investigation.WHAT ELSE IS THE EU INVESTIGATING?Under the DMA, Apple was supposed to make it easy for device users to uninstall software and change default settings, such as their go-to web browser or search engine.The EU said it was concerned the company had not made such choice as easy as it should be for users, and would investigate.The law also requires gatekeepers' platforms to gain explicit consent from users when they intend to combine a person's data across different platforms, such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram.In an attempt to comply with the rules, Meta introduced a ""pay or be tracked"" policy, which would charge consumers who do not consent to their data being collected and combined like this 9.99 euros ($10.82) for ad-free versions of the apps.Following questions over the subscription package's legality, Meta last week said it could reduce the fee to 5.99 euros.On Monday, the EU said the binary choice does not amount to a real alternative for users, and it would investigate.WHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?Google, which made significant changes to its services ahead of the deadline, said it would defend its approach in the coming months. Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA.A Meta spokesperson said the company was trying to comply with the act's guidance.""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,"" Meta said.($1 = 0.9233 euros)(Reporting by Martin Coulter; Editing by Catherine Evans)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/explainer-why-eu-probing-big-163642500.html,AAPL,0.073,0.032,0.895,0.9734,Positive,170.74000549316406,171.08990478515625,0.20493105349360932,0

2024-03-26 15:50:00,"Breaking down the EU’s one-two-three antitrust punch against Apple, Alphabet, and Meta","Hooboy—the European Commission fired an antitrust broadside against some of the biggest tech firms today that could put a major crimp on their businesses. First, let’s quickly break down these three investigations under the new EU Digital Markets Act, then consider the bigger picture.For Apple, I'll begin with what this is not: an investigation into the “core technology fee” that Apple levies on app installations from developers who dare to use the third-party app stores that, under the DMA, must be allowed on iOS in Europe. The Commission is still looking into that matter using “investigatory steps” that fall short of a formal investigation, for now.What was announced today was a two-pronged probe into Apple’s suspected disrespecting of users’ choices—making it too difficult for them to change default iOS settings, search engines, and browsers, and making it impossible to uninstall core apps like Photos—along with failing to let developers freely steer their users to off-platform offers.If those anti-steering tactics sound familiar, that’s because they’re essentially the same reason the Commission just hit Apple with a $2 billion fine under pre-DMA antitrust law and the same reason why Epic Games (aided by Meta, Microsoft, and others) is trying to get a California court to force Cupertino to honor a 2021 injunction about directing users to alternative payment methods. In case you’re wondering, these are among the few Apple tactics that don’t form part of the huge new antitrust case that hit the firm in the U.S. last week.Apple can at least console itself with the knowledge that the Commission isn’t only interested in its potential anti-steering tactics—Android proprietor and Google-parent Alphabet is now being probed over the same thing. What’s more, the Commission wants to find out if Google is “self-preferencing” its own vertical search services like Shopping, Flights, and Hotels in its search results.“Didn’t Google get a $2.7 billion fine over this in 2017?” I hear you ask. Yes, it did, specifically regarding the shopping vertical. Now basically the same issue is back, with a new law in play, and with other industry-specific services joining the party.As for Meta, this one is the logical conclusion of how antitrust and privacy law have been bleeding into each other over the last few years. In order to comply with EU data protection laws, Meta last year started charging European Facebook and Instagram users a monthly fee if they didn’t agree to be tracked for ad-targeting purposes. This “pay or consent” strategy attracted a wave of privacy complaints across the EU, and now it’s being investigated under the bloc’s new antitrust law, which is supposed to stop companies like Meta from abusing their dominant market positions to gather personal data.A Meta spokesperson claimed today that the Subscription for No Ads option had been designed to “address overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA.” Apple also said it was “confident” that it was DMA-compliant. Both companies promised to constructively engage with the Commission during the investigations. No comment from Alphabet just yet.Don’t get me wrong, each one of these cases is fascinating in its own right. But the really interesting thing overall is the urgency with which the Commission has decided to brandish its brand new club, the DMA.When the General Data Protection Regulation came into effect in 2018, the enforcers were national privacy authorities who were under-resourced and understandably wary of getting into expensive legal battles with some of the world’s biggest companies. As a result, those regulators took their sweet time building their cases, and it was more than three years before meaningful GDPR enforcement began.So, with the DMA and its companion law—the Digital Services Act, which tackles illegal content on platforms—the Commission has made itself the enforcer. The true extent of the Commission's capacity in terms of both staff and funding is still an open question, but it has clearly opted to hit hard and early. In a press conference today, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager pointed out that the aim of the law was to get compliance rather than fines (though the DMA does allow fines as high as 10% of global annual revenue)—and the sooner this happens, the better for consumers, she added. The investigations could even wrap up within a year, which is lightning speed for such things.Of course, Big Tech’s lobbyists are appalled. “Launching the first preliminary investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) just days after the compliance deadline throws a wrench into the idea of companies and the European Commission working together to implement the DMA successfully,” spluttered Daniel Friedlaender, the Europe chief of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, in a statement—as though these companies hadn’t had a year and a half to prepare for the compliance date, after the DMA was signed into law in September 2022.Everyone knew this moment was coming. The Big Tech firms carefully crafted their DMA compliance measures to try to get away with as much as they could. The Commission is now pushing back in spectacular fashion.

2024-03-26 15:45:00,Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 5 Stocks.Jim Cramer in his latest program took a jab at the Department of Justice and Washington authorities in general, calling regulators “anti-innovation” who have “contempt” against those who became rich in the technology sector. Cramer was referring to the DoJ’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accused the iPhone maker of  throttling competitive alternatives from other companies and trying to maintain a monopoly in the smartphone market. Cramer said that the regulators hate and “abhor” big businesses because the bigger they are the more successful they become. Jim Cramer, who has been repeatedly recommending Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) during his programs, uring investors to “hold it, not trade it,” said that Washington’s “anti-business bias” was evident when it brought the lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on what Cramer called a “shameful day.”Cramer then highlighted the reasons why he’s been so bullish on Apple, and these thoughts provide an interesting sneak peek into what goes on in Cramer’s mind when he’s choosing stocks for the long-term. Cramer said he did not ask his viewers to hold Apple stock for the long term because it’s a stock with a relatively low P/E ratio or because it has “got the hottest technology out there?” These were not the reasons behind Cramer’s bullish outlook on Apple. Cramer said he recommended holding onto Apple shares because it’s the “most innovative consumer products technology company ever.”In a blunt move, Cramer grabbed a copy of the DoJ’s case against Apple and threw it away, calling it a “loser” case which does not hold any merit. Cramer said that he isn’t worried at all about the DoJ’s case against Apple because he knows a “loser case” when he “sees it.” According to Cramer, Apple pays the “most taxes” and creates the “most jobs.”Cramer said the pullback in Apple shares after the case was expected, but he sees it as a buying opportunity which long-term investors would look back to and thank the Department of Justice for.While Jim Cramer is recommending investors to pile into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), in addition to other tech names like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), he is bearish on some stocks. In this article we will take a look at the stocks he's recommending investors to stay away from.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 5Jim Cramer was recently asked about midstream energy infrastructure company Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA). Cramer said:“I see you, and I raise you with Enterprise Products Partners.”Cramer also said that Enterprise Products Partners is a “better” company than Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA).Last month, during its earnings call, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA) management talked about guidance and expectations:""Looking at 2024 compared to 2023 and as illustrated by the EBITDA walk on Slide 9, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.625 billion to $2.725 billion with year-over-year growth in our Crude Oil segment, partially offsetting commodity price headwinds in our NGL segment. Growth in our Crude Oil segment is primarily driven by anticipated tariff volume increases, higher fees from tariff escalators and full year contributions from bolt-on acquisitions. This is partially offset by our assumption of fewer market-based opportunities. We expect lower year-over-year NGL segment adjusted EBITDA, driven by lower forecasted frac spreads, partially offset by higher C3 plus spec product sales in 2024. I would note that our C3 plus spec product sales volumes are approximately 90% hedged for the year in the mid $0.60 per gallon level.We remain disciplined with our capital investments with approximately $375 million of growth capital and approximately $230 million of maintenance capital expected for the year, net to PAA. This includes capital for POP JV well connections and intra-basin improvement as well as an increase in our capital related to our previously announced Fort Sask debottleneck project. As illustrated on Slide 10 and in addition to a capital discipline, we remain committed to significant returns of capital and maintaining financial ability. For 2024, we expect to generate $1.65 billion of adjusted free cash flow excluding changes in assets and liabilities with approximately $1.15 billion to be allocated to common and preferred distributions inclusive of the respective increases resulting in $500 million of adjusted free cash flow after distributions available for value-creating opportunities, including potential bolt-on acquisitions or net debt reduction.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 13AI-based voice technology solutions company Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another stock Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from for now. While Cramer has expressed excitement about the stock in the past because of Soundhound AI Inc's (NASDAQ:SOUN) partnership with Nvidia, the CNBC host recently said that he won’t buy the stock even at $6 (the stock was trading at around $6.14 as of March 25).Out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey’s database, 13 hedge funds had stakes in Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 18Texas-based energy company Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is currently avoiding. When asked about Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) during the Lightning Round segment of his program on CNBC, Cramer said that there are “so many better” companies than Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK).“I’m going to have to refer you to get to Coterra, CTRA, which is just a better situation.”Insider Monkey’s database of 933 funds shows that 18 hedge funds had stakes in Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) as of the end of the last quarter of 2023. The most notable stake in Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK) is owned by Todd J. Kantor’s Encompass Capital Advisors which owns a $31 million stake in Comstock Resources Inc (NYSE:CRK).While Cramer is bearish on CRK, he's recommending investors to pile into  NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).During its Q4 earnings call, the company talked about 2024 guidance:""First quarter D&C CapEx guidance is $225 million to $275 million and the full year D&C CapEx guidance is $750 million to $850 million. The lower spending versus last year is related to the announced release of two drilling rigs in our press release last night in response to low gas prices. We’ve continued to see signs of some deflationary pressures on service costs, including an improvement in our completion costs per stage. We anticipate spending an additional $30 million to $40 million on lease acquisitions in the first quarter and $40 million to $50 million over the course of the year. Capital expenditures related to Pinnacle Gas Services will be funded by our midstream partner and are expected to total $30 million to $40 million in the first quarter and $125 million to $150 million for the full year.For both the first quarter and the full year, our LOE is expected to be in a range of $0.24 to $0.28 per Mcfe. GTC are expected to be $0.32 to $0.36 per Mcfe and production and ad valorem taxes are expected to average $0.16 to $0.20 per Mcfe. DD&A rate is expected to average $1.30 to $1.40 per Mcf this year. In the first quarter, our cash G&A is expected to total $7 million to $9 million and $30 million to $34 million for the full year. In addition, we’ll have non-cash G&A in the first quarter of $2.7 million to $3 million and $10 million to $12 million for the full year. With the increase in SOFR rates in our current debt levels, cash interest expense is now expected to total $43 million to $47 million in the first quarter and $195 million to $205 million for the year, while non-cash interest will remain approximately $2 million per quarter.Effective tax rate will remain in the 22% to 25% range and we continue to expect to defer 95% to 100% of our reported taxes this year.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 18Mannkind Corp (NSDAQ:MNKD) is a stock Jim Cramer is having mixed feelings about, and he’s recommending investors to stay away from the biopharma company for now.

2024-03-26 15:10:00,"Consumers sue Apple, taking page from US Justice Department lawsuit","By Mike Scarcella(Reuters) - Apple has been hit with a flurry of new consumer lawsuits accusing the iPhone maker of monopolizing the smartphone market, piggybacking on a sweeping antitrust case lodged by the U.S. Justice Department and 15 states last week.At least three proposed class actions have been filed since Friday in California and New Jersey federal courts by iPhone owners who claim Apple inflated the cost of its products through anticompetitive conduct.The lawsuits, seeking to represent millions of consumers, mirror the Justice Department's claims that Apple violated U.S. antitrust law by suppressing technology for messaging apps, digital wallets and other items that would have increased competition in the market for smartphones.Apple has denied the government's allegations. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the consumer lawsuits.Attorney Steve Berman, whose law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro filed one of the new cases, noted that his firm had earlier sued Apple for allegedly thwarting competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet.""We are pleased that the DOJ (Department of Justice) agrees with our approach,"" Berman said.Attorneys behind the other new cases did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Apple is already fighting private lawsuits challenging its business practices as anticompetitive. A judge in February ruled that Apple must face a class action on behalf of millions of consumers claiming it monopolized the market for iPhone apps. Apple denies the claims.Hagens Berman previously secured a combined $550 million in settlements from Apple in separate cases related to its ebook pricing and app store policies.A 2022 study by a University of Buffalo law school professor found that private antitrust class actions can sometimes go farther than government cases, expanding ""the scope of wrongdoing, the amount of recovery, or the number of defendants involved.""(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by Will Dunham and David Bario)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/consumers-sue-apple-taking-page-151036526.html,AAPL,0.068,0.07400000000000001,0.858,0.25,Neutral,170.5301055908203,170.6822967529297,0.08924592029195783,0

This time, coming from the EU. The commission going after Meta, Alphabet, and Apple. The statement saying that the EU has, quote, ""opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act into Alphabet's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the choice for screen for Safari, and Meta's pay or consent models.""Let's talk about what this means for the big tech giant. For Apple, specifically for that, I want to bring in Jim Kelleher. He is Argus director of research here to weigh in.Jim, it's good to see you. So I know you have a buy rating on Apple. You had that buy reading, reiterated that buy rating following the legal update that we got from the DOJ lawsuit against Apple last week. How are you looking at the fact that-- or what does this potentially mean to Apple's bottom line, the fact that now you also potentially have more pressure coming from the EU as well?JIM KELLEHER: So good morning, Seana and Madison. What I would, generally, say is we've followed a lot of companies that have spent a lot of time in the courts over the years, such as Qualcomm. And these things do tend to drag on for a long time, when the government feels that there are unfair practices.What I would say is, I expect over the long term, when I do expect this to take a while to play out, Apple will negotiate and grant some degree of openness to its ecosystem. At the same time, the immense core of Apple and iOS users is going to stay loyal to the company.That's what I'm thinking right now. The impacts on the bottom line are a little hard to quantify. Just looking at Apple's response to the DOJ complaint, they, basically, didn't say, we didn't do it, nor did they say, we're not going to do it in the future.They stood on their principles of how they operate their ecosystem. And said, we're always interested in the security of our devices, first and foremost. So I would look really at the Apple fundamentals. And I'd be willing to discuss those in a moment as being more indicative of the near-- I should say long-term stock drivers.MADISON MILLS: Well, I want to stay on the investigations for a second, because I'm curious if this EU investigation to you felt like a bigger deal than what we saw here in the US.JIM KELLEHER: All right. Well, on a preliminary basis, it looks as if they're also going after the fact that the App Store seems too inclusive, that developers are under compensated, that there's an effective firewall preventing the apps from working as well or working outside the App Store.So I think there will be negotiations all down the line, as this thing unfolds. And Apple will give a little. And EU will give a little. And DOJ will give a little. And, ultimately, the Apple-- the velvet rope will be let down a little bit. The Apple ecosystem will be a little bit more open. But, ultimately, I think Apple will do everything in its power. And I think it does have some power to preserve most of its ecosystem.SEANA SMITH: Jim, I'm curious, at least, with the antitrust case here in the DOJ. There has been some worry starting to trickle through what Apple might be potentially forced to reveal in terms of their business offerings, because we know they're tight lipped. And we don't really get a good look at that.Do you think they are going to be able to maintain some of those confidential arrangements? Or how do you see that potentially playing out?JIM KELLEHER: Again, I think these are things that are a little more on the sidelines. Apple, I don't think there's enormous smoking guns in there. I don't think Apple is behaving unethically. I think they've been operating in the same way they've always been operating.So I'm not expecting big revelations. The confidentiality is going to unmask some horrendous goings on. What I'm focused on right now is the fact that Apple seems to be turning around its operations. If you look at 2023, the stock was up 48%. And yet, at this time a year, ago, in other words, at the fiscal half year mark, Mac sales were down in double digits in revenue. IPhone sales were down about 5%. Overall revenue was down.Now, I know the Street consensus for this year is for slightly down earnings. But if you look at the reality of the first half of this year, you see that Mac sales are up slightly. And you'll see that iPhone sales are up a few percentage points. And they're doing well in every region, excluding greater China. And that's as expected.So I think we're going to see a couple surprise quarters coming forward. And I think we'll do well from here. And devaluation-wise, the stock's trading in line with its five-year historical multiple at a time when big tech names are trading at huge premiums to where they've traded in the past five years.MADISON MILLS: Right. But it's interesting to note that Apple's stock is down about 8% year-to-date still, though, Jim.Thank you so much for joining us. We know we've got to let you go. Really appreciate it.

2024-03-26 15:00:00,"Like the ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks? You'll Love This Vanguard ETF.","The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks have dominated the stock market narrative over the last year, and it's easy to see why.This group of elite tech stocks, which includes Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), returned more than 100% in 2023, and it's off to a good start in 2024, up 17% on average through March 21.However, the Magnificent Seven might not be as magnificent going forward. First, the group of tech stocks has already attracted a lot of attention on Wall Street and among retail investors, arguably lifting valuations beyond where they should be. Second, some members of the group don't look as solid as they once did.Tesla stock, for example, is down 30% this year as electric vehicle sales growth is plateauing, prices in the industry have come down, and the company's production growth is slowing. Apple has also been a stock market loser this year as the iPhone maker has faced headwinds in China, its revenue growth is flatlining, and the Department of Justice just sued Apple, claiming it has a monopoly.Meanwhile, even the Magnificent Seven's top performers like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are likely to slow down as much of their future growth is already baked into their current stock prices.Nvidia has been the leader of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but with its market cap already at $2.3 billion, it would be difficult for the stock to post eye-popping gains from here. Similarly, Meta Platforms has also been a big winner, but much of the surge in profits that came from its cost-cutting has already taken place and won't be repeated.In other words, it looks like the best days of the Magnificent Seven are behind it. If you're looking to move beyond the Magnificent Seven, there's one Vanguard exchange-traded fund (ETF) that looks like a perfect match for investors looking for growth potential in a new bull market. That's the Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF (NYSEMKT: VFMO). Here's why it looks like a winner.The Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF is an actively managed ETF that invests in stocks with the potential to generate higher returns and stocks with a strong recent performance as measured by their performance at multiple intervals over the last year.The fund chooses from the 3,000 largest stocks, represented by the Russell 3000, and, unlike the Magnificent Seven, the Vanguard Momentum ETF is diversified across multiple sectors with 29% of the fund in technology, 19% in industrials, 17% in consumer discretionary, and 15% in healthcare, with the remainder spread across the stock market.The Vanguard Momentum ETF's top two holdings are actually Meta Platforms and Nvidia, but they make up less than 4% of the fund's total value. The rest of the top five includes General Electric, Arista Networks, and Broadcom.The VFMO ETF has 574 stocks, showing that it's well diversified, and the ETF is growing faster and is cheaper than the benchmark Russell 3000. Over the last five years, the portfolio stocks have grown 19.2% and the fund has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.3, making it cheaper than the S&P 500.The fund has also performed well so far this year, up 15.4%, just shy of the average of the Magnificent Seven, though that is distorted by the success of Nvidia, which is up 84% this year.Momentum stocks tend to do well in bull markets as investors recognize them and jump on as they climb. That helps explain the soaring returns of stocks like Nvidia and Meta Platforms.With a new bull market that could just be starting, finding a diversified growth stock fund makes sense, and the Vanguard Momentum ETF is just that. Look for the VRMO ETF to continue to outperform the S&P 500 no matter what happens moving forward.Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Wellington Fund - Vanguard U.s.

That’s considerably more than the $10,000+ RR Auction had expected it to sell for.The card was a rarity and one of the earliest business cards bearing Jobs’ signature. To date, there are fewer than five Jobs-signed Apple Computer business cards that have been authenticated.“The sale of the Steve Jobs-signed Apple business card for over $180,000 sets a new standard in autographed business cards,” said Bobby Livingston, executive vice president at RR Auction, in a statement. “It’s a testament to the enduring legacy of Jobs and the profound impact of Apple on our modern world.”Fetching just a bit less was a check signed by Jobs. In 1976, that check was worth $13.86 to Elmar Electronics. It sold for $176,850. The check pre-dated the official founding of Apple Computer. It was likely used to purchase electronic components that were used in the construction of the first Apple-1 prototypes. Because the company did not yet officially exist, Jobs wrote “Apple Computer” as well as the address of his Palo Alto garage in the top left corner.The pre-auction estimate for the check was $50,000+.Jobs typically did not sign autographs, but made an exception for a random fan in 2003 who swapped his seat during a showing of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl so Jobs and his family could all sit together.“I was seated at the back of the room patiently waiting for the movie to begin when a man accompanied by some children tapped on my shoulder and kindly asked me if I could move by one seat so that they could all comfortably sit together. I gladly accepted and while I was moving, I suddenly realized that I had just spoken to Steve Jobs,” read a letter from the original recipient that accompanied the item. “I did not want to potentially upset him before he could happily enjoy the movie, so I chose to wait until we were leaving the room to address him. … His response was ‘Sure’ and as I had no paper on me, the only thing I could hand him was a pen and my movie ticket that he signed in the palm of his hand.”That ticket stub sold for $14,653.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/steve-jobs-signed-business-card-145741410.html,AAPL,0.08800000000000001,0.032,0.88,0.9794,Positive,170.4250030517578,170.69070434570312,0.15590511320960307,0

MeijerBRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - Apple, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms will be investigated for potential breaches of the EU's new Digital Markets Act, European antitrust regulators said on Monday, potentially leading to hefty fines for the companies.The European Union law, effective from March 7, aims to challenge the power of the tech giants by making it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores. That should in turn open up space for smaller companies to compete.Violations could result in fines of as much as 10% of the companies' global annual turnover.U.S. antitrust regulators are also challenging Big Tech over alleged anti-competitive practices in a crackdown that could even lead to companies being broken up.Tech companies say they have deployed thousands of engineers to meet a Digital Markets Act requirement that six ""gatekeepers"" - which provide services like search engines and chat apps used by other businesses - give users and rivals more choices.But the European Commission said on Monday it suspected that the measures taken fall short of effective compliance under the DMA, confirming a Reuters story.Asked if the Commission was rushing the process just two weeks after the act kicked in, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the investigations should not be a surprise.""The law is the law. We can't just sit around and wait,"" he told a press conference.APPLE COMPLIANCEAt issue is whether Apple complies with obligations to allow users to easily uninstall software applications on its iOS operating system, to change default settings on iOS or access choice screens allowing them to switch to a rival browser or search engine on iPhones.Another concern for regulators is ""steering"": whether Apple imposes limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge.Apple said it was confident its plan complied with the DMA, adding that it had shown responsiveness to the Commission and developers throughout the process and incorporated their feedback into its changes.Regulators say the anti-steering issue also applies to Alphabet. The investigation will examine whether it favours its vertical search engines such as Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels over rivals, and whether it discriminates against third-party services on Google search results.FEES OR NO FEESThe Commission also singled out Apple and Alphabet's fee structures, saying they went against the DMA's ""free of charge"" requirement. Both companies recently introduced new fees for some services.Breton said Meta, which introduced a no-ads subscription service in Europe last November that has triggered criticism from rivals and users, should offer free alternative options.A Meta spokesperson said the company was endeavouring to comply with the act's guidance.""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA,"" the spokesperson said.Google said it has made significant changes to its services and would defend its approach in the coming months.The Commission is also taking steps to investigate Apple's new fee structure for alternative app stores and Amazon's ranking practices on its marketplace.Amazon is another DMA ""gatekeeper"", along with Microsoft and TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance.""Amazon is compliant with the Digital Markets Act and has engaged constructively with the European Commission on our plans since the designation of two of our services,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. ""We continue to work hard every day to meet all of our customers' high standards within Europe's changing regulatory environment.""The EU executive, which aims to wrap up the investigations within a year, the timeframe set out under the DMA, said it has ordered the companies to retain certain documents, allowing them to access relevant information in its current and future probes.The EU investigations came amid escalating criticism from apps developers and business users about shortcomings in the companies' compliance efforts.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Bart Meijer; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Catherine Evans)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/1-eu-target-apple-google-103119823.html,AAPL,0.064,0.026000000000000002,0.91,0.9740000000000001,Positive,169.9949951171875,170.89990234375,0.532314040150826,1

So for Alphabet and Apple steering rules, what they say is that the commission has opened proceedings to assess whether the measures that have been implemented by Alphabet and Apple in relation to their obligations pertaining to app stores are in breach of the Digital Markets Act requiring gatekeepers to allow app developers to steer consumers to offers outside of the app stores free of charge there.And that's something that's come up time and time again.

And the impact that this could potentially have on the bottom line, just putting this in perspective in terms of what this means for Apple's business, the EU accounts for about 7% of App Store revenues. So it is a significant part of their business. And then, of course, the question is, if this happens over in the EU, what exactly will more of that pressure look like here in the US?We had the DOJ lawsuit separate issue, obviously. But the DOJ lawsuit, yes, last week-- excuse me-- pertaining to Apple and some of the concerns there over the monopoly. But then if you move that aside and move also the issues with Alphabet aside, similar sort of scenario there just in terms of their questions about Google Play. But then focus on Meta and what the argument is there.Because that's something that also stuck out to me. You have this pay and consent model, which is looking at the ad subscription model versus whether or not you're going to opt in and let meta share your data. So very separate issues here, but there is pressure across the board on these stocks here in the premarket.

2024-03-26 14:00:00,10 Best Stocks To Buy For Grandchildren,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best stocks to buy for grandchildren. To skip the detailed analysis of financial markets and analysts’ outlook, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Buy For Grandchildren.The world held its breath for almost three years as the global financial markets and economy suffered from one shock after another. The bears were sure that the US economy would be hit by a recession in 2023 or 2024, but the market proved all their predictions wrong and made an impressive comeback on the back of artificial intelligence (AI).While the bulls are quite optimistic about the future, there are still concerns regarding a soft landing or a mild recession. A JPMorgan report points out that there are indications of slowing growth in the current year but not a total collapse and still holds the belief that a mild recession could take place in the next year. The report states:“The challenge for investors: the damage to public sector finances from mega-deficits, markets that already price in a very soft landing and the concentrated contribution of megacap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings were flat; they were up 33% for the 7 megacap stocks and down 5% across the rest of the S&P 500. All things considered, 2024 looks like a year of slowing GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth and single-digit returns on the median S&P 500 stock.”On a global scale, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) January 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) report also contains revisions regarding the IMF’s October 2023 predictions and states that the global growth is expected to be 3.1% in 2024, up 0.2% from the IMF's October predictions. The IMF predicts a 3.2% growth in 2025. Furthermore, it is believed that global headline inflation is expected to fall by 5.8% in the current year and 4.4% in 2025.In this economic environment and volatility, millions of American families would wonder how they could help their children and grandchildren secure their financial future. One of the best ways to do that would be to teach them money management. According to the Wall Street legend, Warren Buffett, sometimes parents start teaching financial literacy to their children later than they should. He said:“Whether it’s teaching kids the value of a dollar, the difference between needs and wants or the value of saving — these are all concepts that kids encounter at a very early age, so it’s best to help them to understand it.”Buying stocks for your children or grandchildren is also a good way to secure their financial future. Value stocks are some of the best options when looking at long-term investments. They are stocks of companies that are considered to be undervalued compared to their intrinsic value or potential for growth. Value stocks have also been endorsed by Wharton School Professor of Finance Jeremy Siegel for the current year. In a CNBC interview, he mentioned the abnormal gap between the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the Russell 1000 Growth and Russell 1000 Value. Based on that, he predicts a 15% gain in value stocks in 2024. Additionally, the best stocks to buy for grandchildren could include stocks with healthy long-term dividends.A close-up of the NASDAQ ticker board displaying the stock increase of a Dallas-based company.Our MethodologyFor this article, we took a look at our article, 12 Best Long-Term Investments for a Child, and checked the portfolio composition of all the ETFs and index funds mentioned in it.

2024-03-26 13:54:00,"Apple, Google and Meta at risk of ‘heavy’ fines as Europe launches new probes","The European Union has launched investigations into Apple, Google and Facebook parent Meta on suspicion that they are failing to comply with a new landmark European law designed to promote competition in digital services.The European Commission said it “suspects” that various practices by all three companies “fall short of effective compliance” with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which went into effect earlier this month. If the probes find a “lack of full compliance,” they could face “heavy fines,” said European Commissioner Thierry Breton.The DMA requires dominant online platforms to give users more choices and rivals more opportunities to compete. It currently applies to the three tech giants under investigation, as well as Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.By mid-May, the list could also include Elon Musk’s X and Booking.com, the EU has said.Violations of the new law can lead to stiff penalties, including fines of up to 10% of a company’s global revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses. For most of the regulated companies, that would translate to tens of billions of dollars.The practices the European Commission is investigating include what it calls Meta’s “pay or consent” approach. Last October, Meta (META) launched a subscription service, called “Subscription for no ads,” allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to €12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions.“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by (large companies),” the body said in a statement.A Meta spokesperson responded: “Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed ‘Subscription for no ads’ to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the Commission.”The EU is also looking into app stores operated by Apple (AAPL) and Google. The DMA states that large digital platforms — so-called gatekeepers — must allow app developers to “steer” consumers to offers outside the two dominant stores, free of charge.Among other concerns, the EU suspects that Apple and Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL) constrain developers’ ability “to freely communicate (with end-users) and promote offers and directly conclude contracts, including by imposing various charges,” the Commission said.“We are concerned Alphabet, Apple & Meta & are not meeting their obligations, e.g.: Apple & Alphabet still charge recurring fees to app developers,” European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager wrote on X Monday.Apple’s “choice screen” for Safari is also under scrutiny, the European Commission said. Under the DMA, Apple must prompt users with “choice screens which must effectively and easily allow them to select an alternative default service, such as a browser or search engine on their iPhones,” it noted.Apple told CNN in a statement: “We’re confident our plan complies with the DMA, and we’ll continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations.”Another of the Commission’s concerns pertains to Google Search. Alphabet may not have done enough to ensure that third-party services appearing in search results are treated in “a fair and non-discriminatory manner” compared with Alphabet’s own services, such as Google Shopping and Google Flights.Oliver Bethell, a competition executive at Google, said in a statement: “To comply with the Digital Markets Act, we have made significant changes to the way our services operate in Europe.“We have engaged with the European Commission, stakeholders and third parties in dozens of events over the past year to receive and respond to feedback, and to balance conflicting needs within the ecosystem. We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.”This story has been updated with additional information.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-google-meta-risk-heavy-114530507.html,AAPL,0.087,0.037000000000000005,0.8759999999999999,0.9839,Positive,170.14500427246094,170.5449981689453,0.23509000349128473,0

2024-03-22 18:35:00,"DOJ says Apple's 'complete control' over tap-to-pay transactions stops innovation, cements its monopoly","In its wide-ranging antitrust complaint against Apple and its iPhone business, the U.S. Justice Department takes specific aim against Apple's massive financial business, specifically how it uses Apple Pay to prohibit competition and make large amounts of money in the process, to the tune of billions in annual revenues.The DOJ alleges that is not only stifling competition among payment services, but it is potentially stifling innovation, since the fees that banks and others fork out to play with Apple Pay amount to them being less inclined to develop other kinds of services that might rival Apple in any way.Apple Pay is no stranger to regulatory controversy. In 2020, the European Commission opened an antitrust investigation into it. And in January 2024, perhaps with a sober regard of the other looming regulatory battles it would be facing this year, Apple finally offered some concessions, where it would allow third parties access to its NFC and related technology to build their own tap-to-pay payment services to bypass Apple Wallet and Apple Pay. (Apple's offer is still being evaluated.)Interestingly, although Europe has been a hotbed for Apple antitrust action -- just earlier this month it was fined almost $2 billion for breaching antitrust rules in music streaming -- that Apple Pay case was the only mention of European activity in the nearly 90-page DOJ complaint.PayPal -- the payments behemoth that has substantial businesses in mobile transactions and point-of-sale technology -- was apparently instrumental in the original EU complaint around Apple's payment monopoly. Contacted today about the DOJ compaint in the U.S., a spokesperson for PayPal said the company declined to comment. (It's certainly keeping a close eye on the proceedings.)Apple today takes a 0.15% fee on any transaction made via Apple Pay. In 2021, that worked out to $1 billion; by 2022, that grew to $1.9 billion, and in 2023, it's estimated that the figure more than doubled to $4 billion.These are, relatively speaking, small sums for the company considering that it made more than $383 billion in 2023 in revenues overall.But Apple's longer-term bet is that payments are central to how people exist in today's world -- ""Apple recognizes that paying for products and services with a digital wallet will eventually become 'something people do every day of their lives,'"" as the DOJ notes -- and thus central to the iPhone ecosystem, iPhone ownership and ubiquity, and the DOJ's complaint.Core to the DOJ's focus is the fact that today, Apple maintains ""complete control"" over how users make tap-to-pay payments using the NFC functionality of their iPhones in the U.S.Its contention is that this has not only prohibited other companies from building tap-to-pay functions in third-party mobile wallets, but also has hindered what is done with the technology. ""Absent Apple’s conduct, cross-platform digital wallets could also be used to manage and pay for subscriptions and in-app purchases,"" the DOJ alleges.Also of concern is the fact that Apple Wallet holds all the cards, literally and figuratively, and it can effectively become a super app that provides much more than just financial functionality (something else that Apple has prohibited from developing on iOS, the DOJ points out elsewhere in its complaint). ""Apple envisions that Apple Wallet will ultimately supplant multiple functions of physical wallets to become a single app for shopping, digital keys, transit, identification, travel, entertainment, and more.""At the heart of Apple's protection of payment functionality is its ability to ""own"" all the customer data that comes with it. That is something that the DOJ has identified and tied in with how Apple's playbook is ultimately about selling its smartphones.""If third-party developers could create cross-platform wallets, users transitioning away from the iPhone could continue to use the same wallet, with the same cards, IDs, payment histories, peer-to-peer payment contacts, and other information, making it easier to switch smartphones.""And because many users already use apps created by their preferred financial institutions, if these financial institutions offered digital wallets, then users would have access to new apps and technologies without needing to share their private financial data with additional third parties, including Apple,"" it writes. ""In the short term, these improved features would make the iPhone more attractive to users and profitable for Apple. Accordingly, the absence of cross-platform digital wallets with tap-to-pay capability on the iPhone makes it harder for iPhone users to purchase a different smartphone.""For now, it's a one-sided development direction: Apple does encourage banks, payment companies like PayPal, merchants and others that build payment-related businesses to incorporate Apple Pay functionality into their own workflow, but for these it's about encouraging transactions on Apple Pay by enabling credit cards to be added to the Wallet, or about incorporating payment facilities into payment apps to take payments -- more transaction revenue for Apple! -- but not to build their own payment features.""Apple simultaneously exerts its smartphone monopoly to block these same partners from developing better payment products and services for iPhone users,"" it notes. In the meantime, Apple has continued to develop Apple Pay, launching -- for example -- its own buy now, pay later offering last autumn (pictured above).The DOJ may have its own major beef with Google, but ironically it comes out a bit of a hero in this complaint. Both Samsung and the Android giant are called out as two examples payment app developers that are not taking fees on transactions made using their payment apps.""Apple’s fees are a significant expense for issuing banks and cut into funding for features and benefits that banks might otherwise offer smartphone users,"" it notes.Apple's counterclaim is likely to be that Apple Pay has removed a significant piece of friction in the purchasing cycle, which actually creates more transactions overall, not less.That might well be true but not as Apple would frame it. Apple Pay and Apple Wallet are both a small part of Apple's services revenues -- which were upwards of $90 billion in 2023 -- or indeed overall revenues. But the DOJ cites estimates from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that say Apple Pay enabled nearly $200 billion in transactions in the United States in 2022, with that figure expected to grow to $458 billion by 2028.That alone speaks to just how central it is and will impact the wider ecosystem, one more reason the DOJ feels it supports its case to call it out now.For more on Apple’s antitrust lawsuit, check here: Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsDOJ claims green bubbles are an issue in Apple iPhone antitrust lawsuitWhy Apple’s antitrust lawsuit could be a silver lining for Epic GamesApple’s iPhone is not a monopoly like Windows was a monopoly Epic, Spotify, Deezer, Match Group and others applaud DOJ’s Apple lawsuitDOJ calls out Apple for breaking iMessage-on-Android solution, BeeperHere’s what the DOJ suit could mean for Apple WatchApple slams DOJ case as misguided attempt to turn iPhone into AndroidThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/apple-pay-doj-iphone-monopoly/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/doj-says-apples-complete-control-183506492.html,AAPL,0.096,0.057,0.847,0.9963,Positive,171.0399932861328,172.84500122070312,1.0553133801582386,1
2024-03-22 18:23:00,"Justice Department sues Apple, alleging it illegally monopolized the smartphone market","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Thursday announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of engineering an illegal monopoly in smartphones that boxes out competitors, stifles innovation and keeps prices artificially high.The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Apple has monopoly power in the smartphone market and leverages control over the iPhone to “engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct.”“Apple has locked its consumers into the iPhone while locking its competitors out of the market,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Stalling the advancement of the very market it revolutionized, she said, it has ""smothered an entire industry.”Apple called the lawsuit “wrong on the facts and the law” and said it “will vigorously defend against it.”The sweeping action takes aim at how Apple molds its technology and business relationships to “extract more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses, and merchants, among others.""That includes diminishing the functionality of non-Apple smartwatches, limiting access to contactless payment for third-party digital wallets and refusing to allow its iMessage app to exchange encrypted messaging with competing platforms.It specifically seeks to stop Apple from undermining technologies that compete with its own apps -- in areas including streaming, messaging and digital payments -- and prevent it from continuing to craft contracts with developers, accessory makers and consumers that let it “obtain, maintain, extend or entrench a monopoly.”The lawsuit — filed with 16 state attorneys general — is just the latest example aggressive antitrust law enforcement by a Justice Department that has also taken on Amazon, Google and other tech giants with the stated aim of making the digital universe more fair, innovative and competitive.“The Department of Justice has an enduring legacy taking on the biggest and toughest monopolies in history,” said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, head of the antitrust division, at a press conference announcing the lawsuit. ""Today we stand here once again to promote competition and innovation for next generation of technology.”Antitrust researcher Dina Srinavasan, a Yale University fellow, compared the lawsuit's significance to the government's action against Microsoft a quarter century ago — in picking a ""tremendous fight” with what has been the world's most prosperous company.“It’s a really big deal to go up and punch someone who is acting like a bully and pretending not to be a bully,” she said.President Joe Biden has called for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to vigorously enforce antitrust statutes. While its stepped-up policing of corporate mergers and questionable business practices has met resistance from some business leaders — accusing the Democratic administration of overreach — it’s been lauded by others as long overdue.The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has assiduously built around the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch to create what is often referred to as a “walled garden” so its meticulously designed hardware and software can seamlessly flourish together while requiring consumers to do little more than turn the devices on.The strategy has helped Apple attain annual revenue of nearly $400 billion and, until recently, a market value of more than $3 trillion. But Apple’s shares have fallen by 7% this year even as most of the stock market has climbed to new highs, resulting in long-time rival Microsoft to seize the mantle as the world’s most valuable company.Apple said the lawsuit, if successful, would “hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect” and would ""set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.Apple has defended the walled garden as an indispensable feature prized by consumers who want the best protection available for their personal information. It has described the barrier as a way for the iPhone to distinguish itself from devices running on Google’s Android software, which isn’t as restrictive and is licensed to a wide range of manufacturers.“Apple claims to be a champion of protecting user data, but its app store fee structure and partnership with Google search erode privacy,” Consumer Reports senior researcher Sumit Sharma said in a statement.The lawsuit complains that Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and that the high margins it earns on each is more than double what others in the industry get. And when users run an internet search, Google gives Apple a “significant cut” of the advertising revenue those searches generate.The company’s app store also charges developers up to 30 percent of the app’s price for consumers.Critics of Apple’s anticompetitive practices have long complained that it’s claim to prioritize user privacy is hypocritical when profits are at stake. While its iMessage services is sheathed from prying eyes by end-to-end encryption, that protection evaporates the moment someone texts a non-Apple device.But Will Strafach, a mobile security expert, said that while he believes Apple needs reigning in, he is concerned that the Justice Department’s focus on messaging may be misplaced and could weaken security and privacy.“I am quite glad that access to SMS messages is restricted,” said Strafach, creator of the Guardian Firewall app.He notes that a number of apps, ostensibly for weather and news, on iPhones have secretly and persistently sent users' GPS data to third parties. Strafach said he is concerned weakened Apple security ""could open the door to stalkerware/spouseware, which is already more difficult to install on Apple devices compared to Android.”However, prominent critic Cory Doctorow has complained that while Apple has blocked entities like Facebook from spying on its users it runs its “own surveillance advertising empire” that gathers the same kinds of personal data but for its own use.Fears about an antitrust crackdown on Apple’s business model haven't just contributed to the drop in the company’s stock price. There is also concerns it lags Microsoft and Google in the push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence technology.Antitrust regulators made it clear in their complaint that they see Apple's walled garden mostly as a weapon to ward off competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices that have propelled its lofty profit margins while stifling innovation.“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland. Left unchallenged, Apple would ""only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” he added.With the attempt to rein in Apple's dominance, the Biden administration is escalating an antitrust siege that has already triggered lawsuits against Google and Amazon accusing them in engaging in illegal tactics to thwart competition, as well as unsuccessful attempts to block acquisitions by Microsoft and Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook.Apple's business interests are also entangled in the Justice Department's case against Google, which went to trial last fall and is headed toward final arguments scheduled to begin May 1 in Washington, D.C. In that case, regulators are alleging Google has stymied competition by paying for the rights for its already dominant online search engine to be the automatic place to handle queries on the iPhone and a variety of web browsers in an arrangement that generates an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion annually.Now that the Justice Department is mounting a direct attack across its business, Apple stands to lose even more.___Liedtke reported from San Francisco.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-kept-illegal-monopoly-over-143222010.html,AAPL,0.11599999999999999,0.08199999999999999,0.802,0.9942,Positive,171.02499389648438,172.4199981689453,0.8156727509110664,1

The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, according to the DOJ.It highlights five examples of technologies in which it says Apple suppresses competition: super apps, cloud streaming game apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets. The company recently added support for cloud-based gaming services and said it would add RCS cross-platform messaging later this year.“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”The Digital Markets Act — which lays out a series of do’s and don’ts for some of the world’s largest tech platforms — allows European Commission to levy hefty penalties of as much as 10% of a company’s total annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for firms who repeatedly flout the rules.

2024-03-22 17:51:00,Justice Department files antitrust suit against Apple,"The US Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL), alleging the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.Apple ""has maintained its power not because of its superiority, but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference Thursday.Apple said it would fight the lawsuit, which it said ""threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.""A victory for the US in this case ""would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology,"" Apple added in its statement.Apple's stock was down more than 4% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.The filing sets up yet another confrontation between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.The Department of Justice is suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) alleging they also violate antitrust laws.The new DOJ lawsuit filed Thursday poses a major new threat to Apple's various revenue streams.Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.The DOJ's suit comes just weeks after the European Commission (EC) fined Apple $2 billion for allegedly breaking competition laws in the bloc. The EC alleged the company illegally wielded its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.The Justice Department suit is just the latest headache for Apple, which is off to a rough start to 2024.Shares of Apple are down 7% year-to-date, as the company struggles with slowing iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market. Apple also lost its title of the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).At the center of the DOJ’s lawsuit is the iPhone, Apple’s most recognizable product.The company harms consumers by making it more difficult for iPhone users to switch to a competing product and to access competing services, according to the government. The complaint also says Apple harms app developers by imposing restrictions on app creation and distribution.That includes everything from text messaging to digital wallets to apps that reduce user dependence on the iPhone.Garland, for example, characterized Apple’s iMessage as anti-competitive, saying that when it is used to text with a Google Android device, the iPhone user’s response is in green rather than blue.That, he said, ""limits functionality."" The videos sent via text, Garland added, can also be pixelated and grainy.He then quoted Apple’s CEO responding to a complaint from a user who said he couldn’t send his mom certain videos: ""'Buy your mom IPhone.'""Apple, the suit alleges, also makes it more difficult for smartphone users to access competing digital wallets by blocking developers from using tap-to-pay functionality in their apps. And it prevents the Apple iWatch from working with Android smartphones, while making it more difficult for someone with an iPhone to use a rival’s smartwatch.""Apple repeatedly responded to competitive threats,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kantor, ""by making it harder to leave, then making it more attractive to stay. The antitrust laws have something to say about that.""Apple, according to the suit, also suppresses cloud streaming gaming apps and denies consumers access to so-called ""super apps,"" which allow users access to a broad range of functionalities from a single interface.The wide-ranging suit is ""about the core unfair practices of Apple,"" Case Western Reserve antitrust expert and law professor Anat Elon-Beck said.""Apple systematically excludes rivals from the Apple ecosystem. By doing that, Apple is hurting so many startup businesses, stakeholders, customers and, in my opinion, its shareholders.""As a result, she predicts that Apple's stock will ""see more downward movement.""This is just the latest antitrust battle Apple has had to contend with in the US.The last was in 2020, when ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games sued the company and accused it of violating antitrust law by prohibiting third-party app developers from offering their own payment methods within their apps —as opposed to using Apple's payment service.Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in that high-stakes dispute. It focused attention on Apple’s App Store — the only place consumers can download apps for iPhones and iPads, and, generally, charges app developers a 30% commission on paid app purchases made through the platform.Apple scored a victory in that case when the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.However, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.Both companies tried to take their fight to the Supreme Court, though the high court declined to take up either appeal.Following that decision, Apple said it will allow developers to offer third-party payment options through their apps. However, the company said developers would still have to pay fees of either 12% or 27%, a move Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called ""anticompetitive.""Apple is in the midst of reconfiguring its App Store payment system in the European Union. Under the E.U.'s new Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company must allow EU customers the option to download third-party app stores and get access to third-party payment options.Apple said it will address the measure and allow third-party downloads and payments, but will still charge developers a 50-euro cent fee for each download if they cross the 1 million download market in a year.Both Epic and Spotify, however, objected to the measure, with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek calling the new rule ""hostile.""Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Traditional EU antitrust probes in contrast take years.Rivals of the three companies have shared frustrations with the EU competition enforcer, saying measures announced by the companies to re-wire their core platform services are inadequate.The DMA requires the three companies, as well as Microsoft , Amazon.com and TikTok owner ByteDance to allow users to remove any pre-installed software or app if they want, and to get users' consent to use their data across their various services or for personalised ads.The companies are not allowed to favour their services or products over rivals on their platforms.Bloomberg was the first to report the imminent DMA investigations into Apple, Meta and Google.

2024-03-22 17:06:00,Is the Apple antitrust suit a silver lining for Epic Games?,"The Department of Justice and seventeen state attorneys general filed a massive lawsuit against Apple on Thursday morning, accusing the company of monopolistic smartphone practices. Meanwhile, Fortnite maker Epic Games has been accusing Apple’s iOS App Store of antitrust violations for years in an ongoing, arduous legal battle.Epic is never named explicitly in the 88-page lawsuit, but the gaming company’s complaints are echoed across extensive discussion of the App Store’s anticompetitive practices.“Apple often enforces its App Store rules arbitrarily,” the suit says. “And it frequently uses App Store rules and restrictions to penalize and restrict developers that take advantage of technologies that threaten to disrupt, disintermediate, compete with, or erode Apple’s monopoly power.”Epic’s core complaint about the App Store is that developers must cede 30% of in-app purchases to Apple. And unlike Android devices, iPhones do not allow for sideloading apps, meaning that Apple has control over any app in its App Store. For almost a decade, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has been a staunch critic of the revenue cut, which he thinks is monopolistic and predatory toward smaller companies. In 2020, Epic made it possible for Fortnite players to pay Epic directly, rather than giving a cut to Apple – then, Apple removed Epic from the App Store, and now, four years later, we’re still watching the two companies duke it out in various legal proceedings.While a judge ruled at the time that Apple can’t prevent apps from routing users to alternative payment methods, the iPhone maker was ultimately not deemed a monopoly.Given past rulings in Apple’s favor, it’s surprising that this lawsuit is aligned with some of Epic’s grievances.“While Apple has reduced the tax it collects from a subset of developers, Apple still extracts 30 percent from many app makers,” the suit says. “Apple also generates substantial and increasing revenue by charging developers to help users find their apps in the App Store—something that, for years, Apple told developers was part of the reason they paid a 30 percent tax in the first place.”Epic isn’t the only large company that has faced off against Apple. In January, as developers prepared for the European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) to take effect, Spotify also stepped into the ring, calling Apple’s compliance plan “extortion” and a “complete and total farce.” Then in March, Apple was fined €1.84 billion for breaching antitrust rules in the market for music streaming services.On Thursday, the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF) – which includes Epic Games, Spotify, Deezer, Proton and other companies – released a statement in favor of the DOJ’s action against Apple.""With today's announcement, the Department of Justice is taking a strong stand against Apple’s stranglehold over the mobile app ecosystem, which stifles competition and hurts American consumers and developers alike,” said Rick VanMeter, executive director of the CAF. ""The DOJ complaint details Apple’s long history of illegal conduct – abusing their App Store guidelines and developer agreements to increase prices, extract exorbitant fees, degrade user experiences, and choke off competition. The DOJ joins regulators around the world, who have recognized the many harms of Apple’s abusive behavior and are working to address it.""Epic Games declined TechCrunch’s request to comment. Sweeney, who is usually vocal about these issues, has also been reticent on the matter.“I’ll be off Twitter antitrust commentary between now and the end of my testimony in the Australian Epic v Apple and Google trial in Melbourne,” Sweeney posted, alongside a photo he took in Melbourne.Apple sued by DOJ over iPhone monopoly claimsThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/apple-antitrust-epic-games/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-antitrust-suit-silver-lining-170611780.html,AAPL,0.067,0.10300000000000001,0.83,-0.9743,Negative,172.2550048828125,172.9149932861328,0.3831461406705204,0

NetChoice Vice President and General Counsel Carl Szabo joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why he believes the Department of Justice faces an ""uphill climb"" in this legal battle.According to Szabo, the monopoly accusations ""just doesn't make sense."" He points out that when Americans buy a smartphone, they have ""two clear choices"": Apple and Android devices, disbarring any assumptions of a monopoly. He notes as this legal battle continues, Apple's innovation efforts may be impacted ""out of fear"" of being accused of monopolistic practices.Szabo notes that as long as Apple can provide evidence that supports ""business purposes for what they are doing,"" the courts will most likely rule in their favor. He suggests that many of the concerns raised by the DOJ can be ""easily dismissed"" due to the legitimate purposes they serve in relation to Apple products like security prevention and payment processing.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithRACHELLE AKUFFO: The DOJ accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws by blocking its rivals from accessing both hardware and software features on its iPhone devices. Now this is the culmination of a five-year probe into one of the world's most valuable technology companies. Joining me now on this is Carl Szabo, NetChoice Vice President and General Counsel.Thank you for joining me this morning. So as we heard there, the Attorney General laying out the grounds for this antitrust lawsuit. What are the key takeaways that we need to keep in mind at the beginning of this?CARL SZABO: Yeah. So this is a really long process. And what we've seen in similar efforts by the Biden administration's Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, when it comes to antitrust, is a kind of Hail Mary pass when it comes to antitrust law. What you heard from the AG was a lot of declarations of monopoly, or declarations of bad business practice when, in fact, we as Americans know that actually, if we want to go buy a device, we actually have two clear choices. We have Apple, and we have Android.So already, the argument that there's a quote, monopoly, on smartphones just doesn't even make sense to the average American. But this will be a really long process. And kind of the process is the pain for a lot of these businesses because as it goes on, Apple will continue to move away from innovation, creating new services and new features for our phones out of fear that this will be then used against them by the Department of Justice as part of this frivolous lawsuit.One of the other important components of this is you didn't hear any real claims of consumer harm. They said consumers are being harmed. But they didn't actually go in to explain how. How are consumers being harmed, because there's really no evidence of consumer harm.What you have seen is devices continue to get better and better. And that is evidence of a clear competitive and functioning marketplace. So the Department of Justice has a real uphill climb when it comes to the courts. Just saying somebody is something doesn't make it so.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Carl, to your point, though, the focus did seem to be on the exclusionary conduct. So not just for certain users. They mentioned, you know, Android users with the green bubble. Some of that cross-platform messaging becoming difficult. And that they were purposely sort of degrading, or limiting, the functionality there. How high of a barrier is that to try and cover, if you're Apple, to really combat that argument?CARL SZABO: Yeah. So essentially, as long as Apple can show compelling business purposes for what they are doing-- the courts have typically gone on the side of businesses. So Apple will say, look, the reason we don't allow you to install your own apps is because we know the security problems. And one of the reasons why people like Apple ecosystem is because they know their devices are safe and secure.Just think about your laptop, computer, where we're constantly worrying about installing malware or spyware. That doesn't really happen on iPhones. And that's because of the closed ecosystem.With respect to payment processing, one of the reasons why it is typically only been allowed through Apple is because as a parent, for example, I get an alert every time my kid tries to make an in-app purchase. If we allowed other payment processors, I wouldn't have such a recourse on my device. So a lot of the complaints that you're hearing are easily dismissed by Apple because of the security and consumer benefits that are being used to offset whatever claims that a business has.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Carl, just quickly. They also mentioned that 30% commission, when it comes to developers who want to be on the App Store. How strong is that argument?CARL SZABO: So this is a little bit of the legal jujitsu that the Department of Justice is trying to do. I actually read their complaint. They claim that it can be up to 30%. But in reality, an overwhelming majority of apps pay $0.00, 0%, to be hosted on the App Store.In fact, it is only the largest of corporations that even begin to pay a 30% commission, or service, for being hosted on the App Store. And that's the same service fee that Microsoft charges on the Xbox. And seemingly, the Department of Justice hasn't weighed in on that as anti-competitive.So what you're seeing is kind of the use of a big number that applies to only a small fraction of big corporations being used to try to explain the entire ecosystem. And that's just not what's happening. Most apps pay $0 on the App Store. And many apps can actually pay $0 even if they're big. Netflix, for example, will not let you sign up through their app. And in fact, Netflix does not pay a single cent to Apple for being hosted on their service.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well certainly, some important context added there.

2024-03-22 16:52:00,DOJ Takes a Bite out of Apple as Buffett Sours on the Stock,"Apple: One of America’s Great CompaniesZacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Apple (AAPL) stands out as one of the great American companies due to its relentless innovation, iconic design, and unwavering brand loyalty. Apple has consistently set industry standards and reshaped technology landscapes from groundbreaking products like the iPhone to its sleekly designed laptops. Its financial success, with a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, underscores its influence and prowess in global markets.Chinks in the Armor?Today, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it sued Apple in an antitrust case over its landmark iPhone product. The DOJ alleges that Apple has a monopoly over the phone market that has harmed consumers, developers, and rival companies. Though I am normally a “free market” person, I believe the DOJ has a good case. Apple can indiscriminately ban apps on its Appstore, and with its overwhelming stranglehold on the smartphone market, it can kill businesses and innovation.Relative WeaknessWeakness tends to beget weakness in the stock market. For example, while the S&P 500 Index was putting in an intermediate bottom in October 2023, New York Community Bank (NYCB) was underperforming – a subtle clue of the damage to come.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, AAPL shares have been stuck in the mud for months and are flashing the same kind of clue.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBear Flag PatternAAPL shares are breaking down out of a daily bear flag pattern on heavy volume – a bearish sign.Image Source: TradingViewLack of Innovation Apple became a powerhouse stock due to its innovation and growth. However, without iconic CEO Steve Jobs at the helm, innovation has come to a standstill. The company killed its multi-year attempt to build an electric car, is behind in the AI race, and has been unimpressive in delivering the “wow” factor in new iPhone releases.Buffett Souring on AAPL Shares?Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F disclosure saw Buffett decreasing his massive AAPL position for the first time in years. Furthermore, AAPL was only mentioned once in Berkshire’s annual letter to shareholders, a hint that Buffett may be selling more stock soon.Bottom LineFlat iPhone revenue, regulatory scrutiny, and a lack of innovation are convincing reasons to avoid AAPL and look elsewhere in the market for growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is an outrage that 100,000 more children are in poverty – they are being forgotten.“These shocking figures should be an urgent wake-up call to all of us, especially the UK Government. We cannot go on like this. There is no reason children should be going without food, heating, toys, or beds.""Unite general secretary Sharon Graham says workers need lower borrowing costs:“It seems that the Bank of England is flatly refusing to recognise the economic reality on the ground. We won’t see a sustainable recovery until workers and their families have some respite from the high interest rates strangling demand throughout the economy.""Workers won’t pay the price for recent years’ sky-high inflation driven by widespread profiteering across the economy.”Read more: When will interest rates fall and what should you do?Easter eggs from brands including Maltesers, Lindt and Cadbury cost at least 50% more than they did a year ago, while others have shrunk in size, a new study has shown.The overall price of chocolate has increased by 12.6% in a year – significantly more than the 5.6% rise seen on supermarket food and drink generally – after dry weather in West Africa led to a spike in global cocoa prices, according to the Which? supermarket food and drink inflation tracker.In the steepest example of Easter egg inflation, a 286g Maltesers Truffles Luxury Easter Egg increased from £8 to £13 at Waitrose in the month to the end of February compared with the same time a year ago – an increase of 62.5%.At Asda, a 50g Lindt Gold Bunny Milk Chocolate five pack increased from an average £2 to £3.11 – up 55.6%.At Tesco, a 250g Ferrero Rocher Golden Easter Egg rose in price from £10 on average in the month to the end of February last year to £15 on average in the same period this year – an increase of 50%.Which? also found that at Ocado, a 1kg Cadbury Mini Eggs Large Pouch cost £8.86 on average last February but £12.95 this year, up 46.2%.At Sainsbury’s, a Kinder Easter with Surprise 36g rose in price from £1.50 on average to £2, or a 33.3% increase.Which? did not include loyalty card prices or multibuys in its analysis.The latest research from American Express has found that the average UK family will spend £3,045 entertaining children during the school holidays in 2024.Some 43% of parents say they expect to spend more entertaining kids during the holidays than term time, with just 7% spending less.Tech devices such as phones, laptops and tablets are the biggest cost to parents when it comes to keeping children entertained.Parents will spend £401 on tech devices to keep kids busy out of term time – with clubs (the likes of sports, drama, music clubs etc.) coming in second at £366.Dave Edwards, vice president at American Express, said:“Keeping kids entertained over the school holidays might not always be easy but our data shows it is a focus of many parents’ spending, whether it’s a meal out with the family, a sports club, or a games console.We know our cardmembers, many of whom are parents, value entertainment and experiences, and our cards offer that – from access to Amex Experiences, to cashback and tailored offers.”The Bank of England has cut its inflation forecast, and now believes it will fall below its 2% target this spring.CPI inflation is projected to fall to slightly below the 2% target in 2024 Q2, marginally weaker than previously expected owing to the freeze in fuel duty announced in the budget.Last month, the Bank forecast that inflation would fall to 2% in the second quarter of this year.In its minutes. The Bank said on ThursdayThe committee had judged since last autumn that monetary policy needed to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipated.The Committee recognised that the stance of monetary policy could remain restrictive even if Bank Rate were to be reduced, given that it was starting from an already restrictive level.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said:In recent weeks we’ve seen further encouraging signs that inflation is coming down.We’ve held rates again today at 5.25% because we need to be sure that inflation will fall back to our 2% target and stay there.We’re not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving in the right direction.For the first time since September 2021, no member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee voted for an interest rate hike.Swati Dhingra voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%, maintaining her dovish stance.The other eight – Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Ben Broadbent, Megan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, and Dave Ramsden – all voted to leave rates at 5.25%.Mann and Haskel had previously voted to raise rates to 5.5% at last month’s meeting.The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the fifth time in a row.The BoE has been trying to bring down inflation to its 2% target without harming the economy but high interest rates have raised borrowing costs for mortgage holders who are paying more each month to the bank.Inflation slowed to 3.4% in February, down from January’s 4%, the lowest since September 2021, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Market analysts argue that with consistent falls in the growth rate of inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee is running out of reasons not to cut rates.Read more hereThe Monetary Policy Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain #BankRate at 5.25%. https://t.co/G4tzjXd6XJ pic.twitter.com/a6ziXsHjXX— Bank of England (@bankofengland) March 21, 2024Shares at Next (NXT.L) jumped as much as 5% in London, touching a record high, after it beat forecasts with a 5% rise in pre-tax profits last year.The fashion and homewares retailer saw pre-tax profits hit a record £918m ($1,172m) in the year to the end of January, which was £3m higher than its previous guidance. It predicted profits would now come in at £960m in 2024.Meanwhile, sales at the high street bellwether increased 5.9% to £5.8bn.Lord Wolfson, chief executive, said: “It has been a long time since we started a year in a more positive frame of mind.

According to the new forecast, inflation is also likely to remain in this range over the next few years.""With its decision, the SNB is taking into account the reduced inflationary pressure as well as the appreciation of the Swiss franc in real terms over the past year. The policy rate cut also supports economic activity. Today’s easing thus ensures that monetary conditions remain appropriate.""Watch: SNB Cuts Key Interest Rate to 1.5% to Contain FrancNationwide Building Society has agreed terms to take over rival Virgin Money, paying 220p per share, including a planned 2p-per-share dividend payout.This is a 38%% premium to Virgin Money’s share price on 6 March, and values it at £2.9bn.The move will now create a combined group with £366bn in total assets, almost 700 branches and more than 23 million customers.It also solidifies Nationwide’s position as the second-largest mortgage lender after Lloyds Banking Group.Bosses at Virgin Money, the UK’s sixth-largest retail bank, could share £6m from the deal.Nationwide said:“Nationwide’s board agreed that a binding offer to acquire Virgin Money was in the best interests of the society and its present and future members, following full consideration and the appropriate due diligence, and after taking comments from members into account.”Watch: How does inflation affect interest rates?Download the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/ftse-100-live-european-stocks-bank-of-england-interest-rates-090205705.html,AAPL,0.1,0.052000000000000005,0.848,0.9992,Positive,172.04989624023438,172.5800018310547,0.3081115434560464,0
2024-03-22 16:50:00,US accuses Apple of illegal monopoly over smartphone market,"The US government has accused Apple of illegally abusing a monopoly over the smartphone market in a landmark legal challenge to the iPhone maker.The Justice Department, alongside 16 states, sued the tech giant on Thursday claiming it prevents users from switching to cheaper rival Android phones by restricting apps that could challenge its power.It is the latest in a wave of landmark monopoly abuse cases from the US government seeking to rein in big tech, and its first against Apple.Merrick Garland, the US attorney general, said: “We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.”Apple said that the case risked the US government interfering in how technology is made, and vowed to challenge it.A spokesman said: “If successful, [this lawsuit] would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple – where hardware, software, and services intersect.“It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.”The US charges centre on claims that Apple deliberately undermines software and accessories that would create a more even playing field between iPhones and Android devices.This includes refusing to make its iMessage app compatible with Android phones, and preventing rival messaging apps such as WhatsApp from sending text messages.The Justice Department’s lawsuit said many smartphone users feel social stigma and exclusion when messaging using an Android phone.It said: “Apple has made the quality of cross-platform messaging worse, less innovative, and less secure for users so that its customers have to keep buying iPhones.”The lawsuit also claims that Apple has restricted so-called “super apps”, which allow users to carry out multiple tasks within a single app, for fear that their adoption would make users less dependent on iPhones and enable easier switching between devicesIt quotes one Apple executive as saying: “Imagine buying a [expletive] Android for 25 bux [sic] at a garage sale and it works fine… And you have a solid cloud computing device. Imagine how many cases like that there are.”US regulators have launched lawsuits against Google, Meta and Amazon in recent years and the case against Apple had been widely expected.The company is also facing new scrutiny in Europe, which has recently introduced laws seeking to rein in big tech’s power. The EU will announce its own probes into Apple and Google under the new Digital Markets Act in the coming days, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

2024-03-22 16:35:00,DOJ vs Apple: Tech giant under fire for antitrust allegations,"The United States Department of Justice has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant Apple (AAPL), alleging that the smartphone manufacturer engages in monopolistic practices. According to the DOJ, Apple's business model restricts competition, resulting in harm to both developers and consumers.Yahoo Finance's Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the details, providing insights into the details of the suit.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith[AUDIO LOGO]RACHELLE AKUFO: The Department of Justice accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws by blocking its rivals from accessing both hardware and software features on its iPhone devices. Now this is the culmination of a five-year probe into one of the world's most valuable technology companies. Here's what Attorney General Merrick Garland had to say just moments ago.MERRICK GARLAND: Monopolies like Apple's threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers. And they increase costs for consumers. If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.RACHELLE AKUFO: Well, for more on this, Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley is here with more. So Dan, give us your big takeaways here. What do we know?- Yeah, Rachelle, I think the main thing that you would look at here is how broad the scope of this suit is. It really seems to go after virtually every part of Apple's business related to the iPhone and App Store.They specifically call out Apple allegedly blocking access to things like digital wallet's ability to use the tap to pay feature so that would be if a third party wallet developer wanted to go ahead and give you the ability to not only use their app, but then go up to a payment terminal at your local store, you wouldn't be able to tap to pay. You would only be able to do that with Apple's wallet. And so they go after Apple for that.They talk about how the Apple Watch is only compatible with the iPhone rather than Android devices. And how Apple makes it more difficult for users of third party watches, those that are not the Apple Watch, to use them on the iPhone by limiting functionality.It also calls out the App Store and how it controls that and the App Store fees that it offers. It further calls out the limiting-- Apple limiting the use of super apps, so-called individual apps that let you control multiple different smaller apps within them, something that Elon Musk is trying to create with X.They also refer to things like cloud gaming. Microsoft has been heavy on Apple with this where they want to get their Xbox Cloud Gaming app onto the iPhone and iPad but haven't been able to. So they forced users to go to a website instead of an actual app which would make it easier.So it really seems as though they're going after a broad number of things with regards to the iPhone itself. And in fact, Merrick Garland talks about in a release the issue with the green and blue bubbles when it comes to messaging saying that Apple is basically doing that itself and making users less secure when they speak between iPhone users and Android users. And that they can change that on their own if they wanted to.So you know, I think the main thing to look at is the potential impact that this could have on some of Apple's key businesses. That includes services through the App Store. That includes wearables through the Apple Watch. And then obviously, the iPhone because if they make-- if they're forced to make these changes, it may make Android phones more appealing to other users.Now that all depends, right? There's the status symbol that the iPhone stands for a lot of consumers. There's also-- so many consumers are now used to it, the comfortability that people have with iPhones. So they may stick around because of that. There's also just the idea that you've already purchased so many goods that go along with the iPhone that seem to work better with it, which the lawsuit is basically calling out, that could be a reason why you may want to stick with Apple.But you know, if there are options out there that look more attractive after this suit, then people may start to try those out, test the waters with Android devices. Maybe Android smartwatches. Maybe that means different app stores that they're able to access. So it could be a big change.And just on the App Store front really quick, you know, this is already changing in the EU as a result of the Digital Markets Act. There's going to be third party app stores on iOS and Android, by the way. And Epic Games said that they're going to release their own App Store on iOS and Android in that region. So it's not something that isn't unheard of obviously within the EU. How long it takes, if it ever takes place in the US, we'll just have to wait and see.RACHELLE AKUFO: Indeed. But clearly, Apple in the eye there of regulators that are on both sides-- both sides there.

2024-03-22 16:26:00,"Green bubbles, Apple Pay and other reasons why America says Apple is breaking the law","“Buy your mom an iPhone.”That was Apple CEO Tim Cook’s famous response at Vox’s 2022 Code Conference, when a reporter complained that her mother couldn’t see the videos she texted to her mom’s Android phone because they were grainy and slow.It’s also a quip that US Attorney General Merrick Garland quoted – and sharply criticized – Thursday at a press conference announcing the Justice Department’s landmark antitrust lawsuit against Apple, in which the Biden administration and 16 states allege Apple is illegally abusing the iPhone’s monopoly power in the smartphone market.The massive lawsuit against one of the world’s largest companies claims Apple is breaking the law by carefully curating its app store and customer experience, designed to lure customers in and keep them buying Apple products and services – to the exclusion of competitors.Apple, in a statement, said it disagreed with the lawsuit and would fight it vigorously.“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,” the company said.If successful, the suit could force Apple to loosen some of the restrictions it has placed on its “walled garden” approach to hardware and software. It could be made to open up its iPhone to alternative app stores and its technologies like iMessage with Android phones.The Justice Department, in its complaint, highlighted five ways it says Apple is abusing its dominant position to the detriment of Americans.With iMessage, Apple created an enhanced text messaging service that allows people to seamlessly communicate with one another, sending rich text, high-quality video and audio that uploads almost instantly – as long as it’s sent to another iPhone customer.When those messages get sent to people with Android phones, they appear grainy, they can be slow to load, and they can miss out on key features like emoji responses, editing functionality and end-to-end encryption. The dreaded “green bubbles” that mark Android users within iMessage – and particularly the lower-quality performance – are illegal, the Justice Department alleges.“As any iPhone user who has ever seen a green text message, or received a tiny, grainy video can attest — Apple’s anticompetitive conduct also includes making it more difficult for iPhone users to message with users of non-Apple products,” Garland said on Thursday. “As a result, iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse — even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging. And it does so intentionally.”Apple last year said it would adopt a new standard of technology for communication with Android phones that will open up some, but not all, of those features. The green bubbles will remain.Apple helped revolutionize the way we pay for things, tying customers’ credit cards to technology inside iPhones to make payments more secure and seamless. And Apple takes a tiny payment for each transaction.But Apple Pay is the only way iPhone owners can pay for stuff using that technology on an iPhone. Apple, citing security reasons, doesn’t allow third-party apps to access the chip that allows for iPhones to make mobile payments. It also could entice some customers to stick with iPhones when they’d otherwise switch to a competitor, the lawsuit alleges.“Apple also deprives users of the benefits and innovations third-party wallets would provide,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Cross-platform digital wallets would offer an easier, more seamless, and potentially more secure way for users to switch from the iPhone to another smartphone.”Apple Watch, one of Apple’s most successful products, is not compatible with Android phones – on purpose, the Justice Department alleges.Although some smartwatches work seamlessly with any kind of smartphone, Apple Watches, a market leader, require iPhones to operate. That locks customers into Apple’s ecosystem of hardware and software, forcing Apple Watch customers to buy iPhones.“Apple uses smartwatches, a costly accessory, to prevent iPhone customers from choosing other phones,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Having copied the idea of a smartwatch from third-party developers, Apple now prevents those developers from innovating and limits the Apple Watch to the iPhone to prevent a negative ‘impact to iPhone sales.’”The only way to get apps on an iPhone is through Apple’s proprietary app store. Apple has long claimed that its approach to maintaining what apps can and cannot be used on an iPhone helps customers. It prevents spam and harmful apps, Apple says.It forces apps into Apple’s onerous limitations and expensive 30% commissions, the Justice Department argues. And it limits competition.For example, the Justice Department cites cloud-based gaming app stores as a service that Apple illegally prevents from appearing on an iPhone. Companies that want to stream games to customers have to load each individual game to the app store, which prevents companies from marketing and selling potentially powerful and popular competitive technology to customers.Apple forces app developers to write code specifically for its operating system, restricting developers from coding using universal languages that could offer a single app experience across any device.That prevents apps from becoming “super apps” – apps that run identically on Apple’s iOS iPhone operating system and Google’s Android OS. Apple also restricts “mini programs” – apps within apps that effectively run on the web. The Justice Department says that requirement locks developers into Apple’s system.“Since at least 2017, Apple has arbitrarily imposed exclusionary requirements that unnecessarily and unjustifiably restrict mini programs and super apps,” the Justice Department said in its complaint. “Apple exerted its control over app distribution to stifle others’ innovation.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/green-bubbles-apple-pay-other-162638606.html,AAPL,0.115,0.07200000000000001,0.813,0.9940000000000001,Positive,172.47999572753906,172.27000427246094,-0.12174829561675174,0

2024-03-22 16:12:00,Apple sued in a landmark iPhone monopoly lawsuit,"The US Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.It’s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the US government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.The complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that ”Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.”“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,” he added.The long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its “walled-garden” approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling – and in some cases, restricting – how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth’s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.The company said it denied the lawsuit’s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government “to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”But Garland on Thursday said Apple’s actions have wide-ranging effects.“Monopolies like Apple’s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,” Garland said Thursday.“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there’s a law for that,” he added.For example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message – but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.The company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors’ products are far more limited in their capabilities.“Apple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,” Garland said on Thursday.This year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone’s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.And Apple maintains a 30% commission on most sales through its app store – a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple’s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.“We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,” Apple said in a statement.Thursday’s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.Apple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a “dangerous precedent” and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love – designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in its statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”Thursday’s lawsuit against Apple seeks three specific remedies that could dramatically change the company’s business model.The Justice Department wants a court order barring Apple from using its app store to block innovative new apps. It also wants the court to block Apple-imposed restrictions that prevent other messaging apps, smartwatches, digital wallets and other technologies from integrating with the iPhone.It also called for the court to prevent Apple from using its contractual terms to “obtain, maintain, extend, or entrench” the company’s alleged monopoly.The complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by CNN, does not explicitly call for a breakup of Apple. But it did not rule out the possibility, and asks for “relief as needed to cure any competitive harm.”According to the complaint, the list of participating states or districts in the suit include New Jersey, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.Apple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.But the Justice Department’s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple’s practices.The case represents the Biden administration’s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under US antitrust law.Apple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold “monopoly power.” Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.The legal action could weigh on Apple’s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.Apple’s (AAPL) stock fell 3% Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.Along with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration’s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.The Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden’s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.Along with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.To solve Android phone customers’ “green bubble” issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.“It lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,” Migicovsky said. “Technologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.”Those kind of interactions have made Apple’s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.Beginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game “Fortnite.”Apple isn’t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.Those rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don’t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.The US government isn’t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.In a seismic move to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.But critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.Since its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It’s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple’s restrictiveness.In the era led by founder Steve Jobs, “Apple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,” said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. “Apple relentlessly innovated. They were always steps ahead of the competition.”Now, however, Apple’s advances are more “incremental” than earth-shattering, Bailey added. “[CEO Tim] Cook has been focused on financial management and expanding market share.”“Apple’s financially healthy,” Bailey said, but their reputation for innovation is “dimming.”This story has been updated with additional context and developments.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-sued-landmark-iphone-monopoly-161210295.html,AAPL,0.102,0.102,0.7959999999999999,-0.6931,Negative,171.9499969482422,172.58999633789062,0.3722008729323098,0

2024-03-22 16:02:00,Tim Cook’s job just got a lot more complicated with an antitrust suit piled on top of his China and Europe problems,"Tim Cook is facing fires everywhere.The U.S. Justice Department and over a dozen states just hit Apple with a long-anticipated blockbuster antitrust suit, covering a vast array of alleged violations that were all aimed at protecting Apple's control of the iPhone ecosystem—placing restrictions on third-party digital wallets and app stores, stymying cross-platform messaging, suppressing cloud gaming services, and more.“Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “We allege that Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market, not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits, but by violating federal antitrust law.""This is the U.S. government attempting to do what the EU is trying to achieve with its crackdown on Apple (and other Big Tech firms) via the new Digital Markets Act. Many elements are shared—but these American claims go even further, by adding things like Apple's refusal to let third-party smartwatches work fully with the iPhone.At the time of writing, Apple's share price had fallen by 2.6%. Make no mistake: If the DOJ and states get their way, Apple's whole way of doing business is under threat, and not just in Europe this time.The suit comes just after Cook launched a charm offensive in China, on his latest visit there. “There’s no supply chain in the world that’s more critical to us than China,” he said yesterday in a China Daily interview. Today he opened Shanghai’s eighth Apple store, chatting with suppliers and taking selfies with customers.He knows he has his work cut out for him there. Apple's iPhone sales are sliding in the face of strong competition from local champion Huawei, and a drive from Beijing itself to have state employees ditch their iPhones in favor of Chinese devices. The flood of ever-cheaper Chinese electric vehicles was probably a major factor in Apple’s decision to abandon its own auto plans. And tech relations between the U.S. and China keep getting testier and testier.While Cook made his visit, Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Biden administration was considering an escalation of its campaign against the Chinese semiconductor industry by applying sanctions against seven chipmakers and chipmaking-equipment firm in the country, all of which work with Huawei in some capacity. The apparent logic is that existing sanctions haven’t stopped Huawei from making great technological strides, including the introduction of the 7-nanometer chip that powers the Huawei Mate 60 smartphone—the same device that’s been taking a chunk out of iPhone 15 sales in China.Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday built on last week’s anti-TikTok bill by passing a new data-privacy bill called the “Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act.” If it then makes its way through the Senate and gets President Joe Biden’s signature, this law would make it illegal for data brokers to pass on Americans’ sensitive data to any foreign adversary country, which means China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and the Venezuelan regime.And it looks like this measure has a better shot than last week’s bill, which would force China’s ByteDance to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese concern or see it banned in the U.S. It passed the House 414-0, whereas the TikTok bill passed by 352-65. As Politico notes, even opponents of the TikTok bill like this one because, rather than targeting a particular company, it would limit what an entire sector can do with Americans’ data, making it the first potential federal data-privacy law in a long time. “This is what we should have voted on last week,” Gen Z Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) told the publication.All the Cookian charm in the world can’t make up for this growing U.S. hostility to China’s tech interests, and the responses it will trigger if this continues. And as for the rapidly metastasizing threats to Apple's controlling nature…well, I wouldn't want to be in Cook's shoes right now.More news below.David MeyerWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/tim-cook-job-just-got-160233868.html,AAPL,0.078,0.08,0.843,-0.3834,Neutral,172.05999755859375,172.8699951171875,0.4707645996088727,1
2024-03-22 16:01:00,US Sues Apple in Antitrust Case Over iPhone,"(Bloomberg) -- The US Justice Department and 16 attorneys general sued Apple Inc., accusing the iPhone maker of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices.Most Read from BloombergNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is UnpaidBaltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 EachJustice Department to Sue Apple for Antitrust Violations as Soon as ThursdayWhat Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million BondYemen’s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won’t Be TargetedThe suit, filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court, marks the culmination of a five-year probe into the world’s second-most-valuable technology company. The Biden administration has made competition a cornerstone of its economic policy, with Silicon Valley becoming a key focus. And it comes as the European Commission is gearing up to announce probes into compliance with the Digital Markets Act — the European Union’s new gatekeeper rules for Big Tech — by Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Shares of Apple were down as much as 3.8% on the news, their biggest intraday decline since Feb. 2.The lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services.“This case is about freeing smartphone markets from Apple’s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future,” according to the suit, which seeks changes in Apple’s practices.‘Dangerous Precedent’US Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference that Apple has “consolidated its monopoly power not by making its own products better but by making other products worse.”The company said the lawsuit was “wrong on the facts and the law,” warned that it would “set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology” and vowed to “vigorously defend against it.”“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love — designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,” the company said in a statement. “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.”Apple recently added support for cloud-based gaming services and said it would add RCS cross-platform messaging later this year.The group of attorneys general includes those of California, New Jersey and Washington, DC.Meanwhile, even though Apple has made several changes to its App Store policies in Europe to comply with the Digital Markets Act, Apple and Google are set to face full-blown EU probes into their compliance in the coming days, Bloomberg reported Thursday.The US probe comes despite Cupertino, California-based Apple having announced earlier that it will allow European users to download iPhone apps from the web, let developers offer discounts outside the App Store and permit third-party marketplaces to sell apps.The Trump administration’s Justice Department opened its antitrust probe of Apple in 2019. A 2020 House investigation into four tech giants found that Apple operates as a monopoly in software distribution on the iPhone, generating massive profits from commissions of as much as 30% that it charges developers.In 2020, Epic Games Inc., the maker of the popular online video game Fortnite, sued Apple over its App Store. A federal judge found the App Store policies didn’t violate federal antitrust law but did breach California state law.As a result of that case, Apple said in January that it would allow US developers to use alternative payment systems, but charge a lower fee of 27% for most digital purchases or 12% on subscriptions. Epic is contesting those changes, saying they are inadequate.On Wednesday, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and X Corp., the company formerly known as Twitter, also took aim at Apple’s proposed changes, saying the iPhone maker has imposed onerous limitations on links to alternate payment systems.Latest Antitrust ChallengeThe US lawsuit is the latest in a string of antitrust cases challenging the tech giant. Earlier this month, the European Union fined Apple €1.8 billion ($2 billion) for shutting out rival music services on the iPhone. Apple is appealing.Read More: Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to ChinaLast week, the company reversed course and said it would restore Epic’s developer account, allowing the Fortnite maker to build its own EU app store, which could compete with Apple’s own. That came a day after Brussels regulators questioned Apple’s decision to bar Epic and raised the prospect of further fines for the iPhone maker.The latest case marks the third time the Justice Department has sued Apple for antitrust violations in the past 14 years. In 2010, the company agreed to settle allegations that it illegally agreed not to poach employees from Google, Adobe Inc. or Walt Disney Co.’s Pixar.Two years later, the Justice Department sued Apple and book publishers for illegally fixing the price of e-books sold on the iPad. After the Justice Department won at trial, Apple was forced to accept a monitor and adopt policies and training to improve its compliance with antitrust law.Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter said on Thursday that the Justice Department’s suit is distinct from previous lawsuits against Apple, arguing that the company has engaged in a deliberate decadelong course of conduct to maintain and extend its iPhone monopoly. He also pushed back on claims that the case would undermine consumer privacy and security on smartphones.“Apple’s conduct has made its ecosystem less private and less secure,” Kanter said at the press conference.--With assistance from Bob Van Voris, Mark Gurman and Samuel Stolton.(Adds quotes, details, EU news and context in first two sections and Kanter quote at end.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionWall Street and Silicon Valley Elites Are Warming Up to TrumpWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

2024-03-22 15:58:00,Factbox-US takes on Apple as efforts to curtail Big Tech gather momentum,"(Reuters) - Apple was on Thursday sued by the U.S. Department of Justice, the latest antitrust action against Big Tech firms accused by regulators of operating monopolies and abusing their power.The case is the fifth by the U.S. government aimed at reining in tech giants. Below are some such actions and other lawsuits:APPLEThe U.S. Justice Department has been probing Apple since 2019 and alleged on Thursday that the company has imposed software and hardware limitations on its iPhones and iPads to impede rivals from effectively competing.The California-based firm is also under regulatory scrutiny in Europe and was earlier this month hit with a 1.84 billion euro ($2 billion) fine for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals through restrictions on its App Store.Apple is appealing the penalty but faces more scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Markets Act — new rules for Big Tech that went into effect earlier this month.Other lawsuits include a class action filed on March 1 in San Jose, California federal court accusing the company of monopolizing the market for cloud storage in its mobile devices.ALPHABETThe evidentiary phase of a court battle between Google and the U.S. government wrapped up in November. In the trial, which started on Sept. 12, the Justice Department sought to prove that Google is a monopolist and illegally abused its power to favor its bottom line.The case, filed by the Trump administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in tech giants.Google was in February hit with a 2.1-billion-euro lawsuit by 32 media groups including Axel Springer and Schibsted, alleging that they had suffered losses due to the company's practices in digital advertising. Last month, Google also asked a U.S. judge to throw out a jury verdict in a lawsuit by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games that found the technology giant had abused its market dominance in setting rules for its app store. Epic Games had prevailed in the high-profile antitrust trial that if it holds could upend the entire app store economy.META PLATFORMSAn appeals court ruled earlier this month that Meta cannot stop the U.S. Federal Trade Commission from reopening a probe into its Facebook unit's privacy practices for now. The company had objected, citing the $5 billion fine it paid and range of safeguards it had agreed.In October, dozens of U.S. states sued Meta and its Instagram unit, accusing them of fueling a youth mental health crisis by making their social media platforms addictive.The company was hit with a record 1.2 billion euro fine by its lead European Union privacy regulator in May 2023 over its handling of user information and given five months to stop transferring users' data to the U.S.AMAZON.COMThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com in September, charging the company with harming consumers with higher prices.The FTC has also filed other lawsuits against the company, including one accusing the e-commerce giant of duping ""millions of consumers"" into purchasing subscriptions for Prime services.($1 = 0.9178 euros)(Reporting by Priyanka.G, Jaspreet Singh and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/factbox-us-takes-apple-efforts-155801147.html,AAPL,0.053,0.107,0.84,-0.9816,Negative,172.00999450683594,172.55999755859375,0.319750636196872,0
2024-03-22 15:51:00,DOJ Sues Apple Over Smartphone Market Monopoly,"Apple has found itself on the wrong end of a civil antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and 16 other state and district attorneys general. The lawsuit accuses Apple of monopolizing smartphone markets, violating the Sherman Act.The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. According to the lawsuit, Apple illegally maintains a monopoly over smartphones by selectively imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access points from, developers.The DOJ says Apple undermines apps, products and services that would otherwise make users less reliant on the iPhone, promote interoperability, and lower costs for consumers and developers. The company also exercises its monopoly power to extract more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants.Most Read on IEN:Can the World’s Largest Plane Save Wind Power?Unilever to Cut 7,500 JobsPODCAST: GM Tattles on Drivers, Weird Chinese EVs, CEO Sells Fake ImplantsPair Accused of Stealing Battery Manufacturing Secrets from TeslaIn a statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland says Apple has allegedly held monopoly power in the smartphone market by violating federal antitrust law, not just by staying ahead of the competition on its own merits. ""If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,"" Garland adds.The lawsuit contends that Apple uses its control over the iPhone to engage in a broad, sustained and illegal course of conduct designed to maintain its monopoly while extracting as much revenue as possible. The complaint alleges that Apple's anticompetitive course of conduct has taken several ever-evolving forms, including:Blocking Super Apps: Apple has disrupted the growth of apps with broad functionality that would make it easier for consumers to switch between competing smartphone platforms.Suppressing Mobile Cloud Streaming Services: Apple has blocked the development of cloud-streaming apps and services that would allow consumers to play video games and other cloud-based applications without paying for expensive smartphone hardware.Excluding Cross-Platform Messaging Apps: Apple has made the quality of cross-platform messaging worse, less innovative and less secure for users.Diminishing Functionality of Non-Apple Smartwatches: Apple has limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches, so users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones.Limiting Third-Party Digital Wallets: Apple has prevented third-party apps from offering tap-to-pay functionality, inhibiting the creation of cross-platform third-party digital wallets.The complaint also alleges that Apple's conduct affects web browsers, video communication, news subscriptions, entertainment, automotive services, advertising and location services.""For years, Apple responded to competitive threats by imposing a series of 'Whac-A-Mole' contractual rules and restrictions that have allowed Apple to extract higher prices from consumers, impose higher fees on developers and creators, and to throttle competitive alternatives from rival technologies,"" says Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, in a statement. He says the lawsuit seeks to ensure Apple cannot deploy the same tactics in other vital markets.Apple is a publicly traded company.

""We allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary, anticompetitive conduct that hurts consumers and developers.""For consumers, he said, Apple's conduct has resulted in fewer choices and less innovation. For developers, it has ""meant being forced to play by rules that insulate Apple from competition.""""We allege that Apple has consolidated its monopoly power not by making its own products better but by making other products worse,"" Garland said.He added that Apple accomplishes this in two main ways: one, by imposing heavy fees on third-party developers who use Apple's ecosystem, and two, by ""restricting connections"" between these third-party apps and Apple's user interface.Garland cited difficulties in cross-platform messaging from an iPhone user to a non-iPhone user, saying that Apple ""knowingly degrades quality and security for its users, making iPhone users perceive other phones as lower quality even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging.""Apple said in a statement that disagrees with the lawsuit, adding that it will ""vigorously defend against it.""""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" Apple said.

If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple... We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.”Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith, Brad Smith, and Alexis Keenan report the breaking details.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich.SEANA SMITH: Breaking news, the Justice Department alongside 16 attorneys general filing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple just moments ago. The DOJ accusing Apple of violating antitrust laws by blocking its rivals from accessing both hardware and software features on its iPhone devices. Our legal reporter Alexis Keenan joining us now on set with these details. Alexis, what are we learning?ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, so so far this is what Bloomberg is reporting. We're waiting to get a copy of the suit. And what it says is that these AGs and the DOJ have filed antitrust claims against Apple in federal court in New Jersey.And it's targeting the iPhone ecosystem, saying that the company maintains its dominance over that ecosystem by blocking competition for services like financial services businesses. So think about payment apps, also device trackers, things like the AirTag. And what they're saying is that Apple is stifling innovation, stifling competition, alleging that the company is using its power over this app distribution on the app phone in order to block competition.Now, in response, Apple is saying this, ""The lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent,"" they say, ""empowering the government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology.""Now, this is a major target against Apple because if you take a look at its annual revenues for 2023, you have the iPhone, right, as its biggest driver of revenue, $200 billion last year. So this is a major threat to the company.And if you go back to the lawsuit that-- the antitrust lawsuit that Epic and Apple were battling out over the course of the last few years that the DOJ joined, that lawsuit it had to do with the App Store. But importantly, it was targeting part of this ecosystem.Now, you have the iPhones, the App Store, iWatch, iMessage, AirTags, all potentially involved in this suit. But just such a big deal. And during the testimony in that Apple and EPIC trial, Tim Cook got up, took the stand.And what he was talking about was that Apple needs to produce its products in this way in this ecosystem because they say it protects people's data security, protects their personal privacy. This, Apple said, was of pinnacle importance to the company. They want to be able to produce products this way.So I would not be surprised if when we hear Apple's response further in this case, if we might hear echoes of that. And that's what I'm seeing here in this statement from Apple saying that it would be a dangerous precedent for the government to have a hand in trying to tell companies how they should do things like protect data.BRAD SMITH: And precedent is the key word here too because it's not just the US and how they would potentially look at it regulators here. But then also elsewhere around the world, where might they face similar tests? And how could that mindset that now the DOJ and multiple attorneys general that they're moving with-- moving forward with, how could that permeate more broadly and potentially impact Apple as well?ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, it already has, arguably, right? Because you had the EU, the European Commission, its antitrust regulator there, just last week or so, a $2 billion fine against Apple. But it was targeting the way that the company handles music apps within the App Store.So most of the litigation so far, most of the antitrust complaints have been specifically about the App Store. So what this does is it really broadens that antitrust lens. We still need to take a harder look and a more detailed look at this complaint to get to the actual-- the specifics here. But no doubt, this is a major broadening of what is being targeted in Apple's products.SEANA SMITH: And, Alex, I'm curious just in terms of what this could also tell us about further pressure for not just Apple but also for some of the other tech competitors out there, very different business models obviously, this specifically targeting the App Store and iPhone. But what this could, I guess, lend to some of the activity that we could see given the focus that we see from the DOJ on Apple at this point.ALEXIS KEENAN: Yes. And not just DOJ, the FTC as well, right. So Apple's been kind of this late comer getting on the defensive side of these antitrust arguments. You have the DOJ's case against Google in Washington, DC, pending against search and search advertising.Any minute now, we could get a decision from the judge in that case. That one's being handled by a judge. Big case against Google there. Also you have the FTC going after Amazon, going after Facebook, and unsettled cases.You have another case with states going after Google on similar grounds. So Apple now being added to this fray. Certainly, the Biden administration making these major pushes on antitrust front against these big tech companies.But also these investigations, many of them started with the Trump administration, so we can't necessarily say it's attributable to the Biden administration. And look, this case, this Apple case, this will extend long past this current administration. And if the history is any indicator, we could see these cases go out as far as decades, right, in the case of Microsoft. And they can go on quite a long time.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Absolutely massive case for us to track going forward. Alexis, thanks so much for joining on the snap here to make sure that we can break this down. Appreciate it.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/doj-accuses-apple-iphone-monopoly-151205746.html,AAPL,0.079,0.055,0.866,0.9705,Positive,172.3350067138672,172.1999969482422,-0.0783414630604684,0

Apple has been in a protracted legal battle with Epic Games, a video game developer that argues the ubiquity of iPhones have essentially turned Apple's App Store into a monopoly.Epic accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust rules in 2020 by charging up to 30% commissions on in-app payments on its iPhone Operating System (iOS) devices.Apple reversed its decision to block Fortnite video game developer Epic Games from launching its own online marketplace for iPhones and iPads in Europe on Friday.APPLE IPHONE SALES IN CHINA PLUMMET 24% AS HUAWEI SMARTPHONE SALES SURGEThe move to allow Epic to proceed with its plans follows the European Union’s deadline on March 14, requiring big tech companies to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a set of rules banning Apple and Google from controlling which apps can be distributed on devices with iOS or Android operating systems.Regulators reportedly warned Apple about its decision to block Epic’s potential return, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said.""I take note with satisfaction that following our contacts, Apple decided to backtrack its decision on Epic exclusion,"" Breton posted on X. ""From Day 2, #DMA is already showing very concrete results.""APPLE HIT WITH NEARLY $2B EU ANTITRUST FINEEpic ultimately lost its court battle on U.S. antitrust rules violations, however, and the game maker’s plan to break Apple’s rules in protest got the popular Fortnite game banned from Apple devices.

2024-03-22 14:57:00,"U.S., California sue Apple, alleging company monopolized smartphone market","The U.S. Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general, including California's, filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, alleging that the technology giant attempted to monopolize the smartphone market to boost its business.The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey, alleges that Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple violated antitrust laws by preventing other companies from offering applications that compete with Apple's products or that make rival smartphones more attractive to iPhone users. The lawsuit comes after a years-long investigation into the company's business practices.The lawsuit seeks to restore competition in the tech market to protect customers from higher prices and expand their product choices. The government took issue with Apple restricting access to points of connection between third-party apps and the iPhone operating system, which makes those non-Apple apps and accessories less useful, said U.S. Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland.""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,"" Garland said during a news conference Thursday. ""We allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary, anticompetitive conduct that hurts both consumers and developers. For consumers, that has meant fewer choices; higher prices and fees; lower quality smartphones, apps, and accessories; and less innovation from Apple and its competitors.""IPhones are the most popular smartphone in the United States, accounting for more than 60% of sales, analysts say. Its main competition comes from phones made by Samsung and other manufacturers that run Alphabet's Android operating system.Read more: Apple to pay $490 million to settle allegations that it misled investors about iPhone sales in ChinaApple generated annual net revenues of $383 billion in 2023 and a net income of $97 billion. IPhone sales made up the largest chunk of the company's revenue in its most recent quarter.“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" an Apple spokesperson wrote in a statement. ""If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.""The government alleges that over the years, Apple has blocked banks and other finance companies from developing alternative payment products that would compete with Apple's digital wallet on the iPhone. At the same time, the company has encouraged those banks to participate in Apple Wallet. Apple has also made it challenging for someone with an iPhone to use non-Apple smartwatches and other connected devices in an effort to boost its own products, Garland said.Garland used text messages between iPhone and Android users as an example of the company's alleged monopolistic practices. He argued that Apple purposely diminishes the functionality of its own messaging app and other apps to degrade quality when interacting with non-Apple devices — leading to conversations that can't be encrypted, videos with lower picture quality, and the loss of editing functions and message-in-progress indicators— in an effort to make iPhones seem to be a superior product.""As a result, iPhone users perceive rival smartphones as being lower quality because the experience of messaging friends and family who do not own iPhones is worse — even though Apple is the one responsible for breaking cross-platform messaging,"" Garland said.John Bergmayer, legal director at the nonprofit public interest group Public Knowledge, applauded the lawsuit, calling it a crucial step toward restoring competition and boosting innovation in the mobile ecosystem.""Consumers are paying the price for Apple's abuse of its gatekeeper power — not just in higher smartphone prices, but in reduced innovation and a more limited, locked-down user experience,"" Bergmayer said in a statement. ""As the complaint describes, privacy and security do not justify Apple’s actions. Protecting users does not justify, nor require, anticompetitive and illegal conduct.""""In fact, as the complaint alleges, Apple’s actions can harm the security and privacy of smartphone users, by putting obstacles in the way of secure, cross-platform messaging,"" he said.Read more: Stalked with an AirTag? A class-action lawsuit against Apple in California will move forwardThursday's lawsuit is the latest lodged by U.S. officials against large technology companies. The government has also filed antitrust complaints in recent years against Amazon, Google and Meta.This isn't the first time Apple has faced scrutiny.The Justice Department last sued Apple in 2012, accusing the company of colluding with book publishers to fix e-book prices. Apple was required to pay a $450-million settlement in the case.Epic Games, the maker of ""Fortnite,"" sued Apple in 2020 alleging that the company violated federal law because it banned third-party app marketplaces on its operating system, requiring all developers to use Apple's App Store. The dispute began after Apple booted “Fortnite” from the App Store because Epic had created a workaround to paying the 30% fee Apple collected from developers on customers’ in-app purchases.A U.S. District judge ruled in that case that Apple didn't maintain a monopoly in the market for mobile games, but ordered the company to permit developers to alert customers to different payment options outside the App Store.Apple was also hit this month with a $2-billion penalty by the European Union following an investigation into allegations it prevented music streaming competitors, such as Spotify, from communicating with users about deals that could draw customers away from Apple's App Store.Although European regulators have focused largely on the company's App Store, the U.S. government's case is much more sweeping, taking aim at Apple's entire menu of products and services.Deputy Atty. Gen. Lisa Monaco said that Apple has been working for years to tighten its hold on the smartphone market, shortchanging consumers.""It has done so not through product improvements — but by maintaining a chokehold on competition — locking its customers in to the iPhone while locking its competitors out of the market,"" Monaco said.

2024-03-22 14:30:00,US takes on Apple in antitrust lawsuit,"By Doina Chiacu and Stephen NellisWASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday sued Apple, the first major antitrust effort against the iPhone maker by the Biden administration, alleging it monopolized smartphone markets.Apple joins a list of major tech companies sued by U.S. regulators, including Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com across the administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.""Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.""The Justice Department alleges that Apple uses its market power to get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants.The civil lawsuit accuses Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as lawsuits from corporate rivals such as Epic Games.One of Apple's most lucrative businesses - its App Store, which charges developers commissions of up to 30% - has already survived a lengthy legal challenge under U.S. law by Epic. While the lawsuit found that Apple did not violate antitrust laws, a federal judge ordered Apple to allow links and buttons to pay for apps without using Apple's in-app payment commission.In Europe, Apple's App Store business model has been dismantled by a new law called the Digital Markets Act that went into effect earlier this month. Apple plans to let developers offer their own app stores - and, importantly, pay no commissions - but rivals such as Spotify and Epic argue Apple is still making it too hard to offer alternative app stores.The rulings on Apple's App Store forced the Justice Department to look at Apple's other practices for the basis of a complaint, such as how Apple allows outside firms to access the chips and sensors in the iPhone.Consumer hardware firms, such as smart-tracker maker Tile Inc, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.Similarly, Apple has restricted access to a chip in the iPhone that allows for contactless payments. Credit cards can only be added to the iPhone by using Apple's own Apple Pay service.And Apple has also faced criticism over its iMessage service, which only works on Apple devices.Apple has long argued that it restricts access to some user data and some of the iPhone's hardware by third-party developers for privacy and security reasons.

2024-03-21 15:23:00,Google becomes the first AI company to be fined over training data,"Nearly five years ago, I reported on how France’s news publishers had gone to war with Google over the issue of “ancillary copyright” fees—payments for including snippets of article text in Google’s search results. I wrote that the media houses were unlikely to win. Well, they just did. And as with everything else these days, AI suddenly became part of the equation.This morning, the French competition authority fined Google €250 million ($271 million) for failing to comply with commitments it made a couple years ago regarding how it would negotiate the fees with the French news outlets. Google already received a €500 million fine over the matter in 2021. It’s not arguing back this time, which has probably spared it an even higher fine.I’m not going to go into the details of the revised negotiation process to which Google has agreed—it’s as dull as it sounds and, if you really want to dive in, here’s Google’s statement in French and English. The interesting part of this episode is about Google’s Bard AI, which these days goes by the name of Gemini.As far as I’m aware, this is the first fine to be levied on an AI company at least partially because of its free-wheeling incorporation of everything it can grab into its training data.According to the French Competition Authority (FCA) the fine takes account of the fact that Google “used content from press agencies and publishers to train its [Bard] foundation model, without notifying either them or the [FCA].”As Google tells it, the FCA “does not challenge the way web content is used to improve newer products like generative AI.” Google claimed this issue is “already addressed” in Article 4 of the EU Copyright Directive, which provides an exception for text and data mining, and in the upcoming EU AI Act, which tells AI companies to respect the Copyright Directive (and to publish “sufficiently detailed” summaries of their training data).But according to the FCA, the question of whether article-scraping AI companies qualify for that text and data mining exception “has not yet been settled.” It said Google had “at the very least” broken its commitment to be transparent in its commercial dealings with French news publishers, making this a fining matter.Now, Google did recently launch a new control in the robots.txt file that web publishers use to send signals to Google’s web crawlers. The setting is called Google-Extended, and it’s supposed to let publishers opt out of having their data become Bard/Gemini training fodder without also having their articles disappear from Google Search and Google News.But it only added that control at the end of September, more than two months after Bard’s European launch. During that period, French publishers effectively had to allow the unrestricted hoovering of their output into Bard if they also wanted it to appear in Search and News—which, remember, is how they then get to claim ancillary copyright fees from Google. That broke another of Google’s commitments, again contributing to today’s fine. The FCA also told Google to explain to publishers how the opt-out mechanism works.So in summary, Google’s new control for publishers has belatedly fixed one of the issues with the unpaid incorporation of news articles into its AI training material, but the overall legality of this practice under EU copyright law remains an open question. It’s not hard to see why Google's big rival, OpenAI, has started cutting licensing deals with European press publishers like Axel Springer and Le Monde.One final note while we’re on the subject of Big Tech and European antitrust regulators: Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s competition chief, just told Reuters that Apple may face a probe over the €0.50-per-app-installation “core technology fee” it’s levying on developers who dare to use the third-party iOS app stores that Apple must allow under the new EU Digital Markets Act. “There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA,” she said.Given that Microsoft and Meta have both complained to Vestager that the fee makes third-party app stores unviable, there’s a storm a-coming, and I do not hate to say I told you so.

Businesses like Alphabet and Apple have demolished most of their competitors, such as Yahoo and Blackberry.Investors might think it is impossible to compete with the Magnificent Seven tech stocks at this point. But that is not the case in every sector. Enter Spotify (NYSE: SPOT). The leading music and audio streaming service has blazed its own path worldwide despite major competition from the likes of Apple, YouTube, and others. With the stock up 222% since the start of 2023, is now the perfect time to hop on the Spotify growth train?Spotify is well-known for its audio streaming application. It allows users to play any music from around the world -- along with podcasts and audiobooks -- with only an internet connection. To make money, Spotify charges users a monthly subscription to access music without advertisements, along with a few other features. This is where the majority of its $14.4 billion in annual revenue comes from today. Since going public in 2018, Spotify's revenue is up 209% in U.S. dollars. Since 2015, its premium subscribers have grown from 28 million to 236 million.It has done so despite intense competition from Apple and YouTube (which is owned by technology conglomerate Alphabet). Apple released Apple Music in 2015, which was a copycat of Spotify's service. It has since reached an estimated 100 million paying users, while Spotify has added 200 million paying users. YouTube Music now has an estimated 100 million paying users as well. While both competing services are sizable, it is remarkable that Spotify is still winning, considering both Apple's and YouTube's services are bundled with other products at a heavy discount to Spotify.These companies also own the two distribution platforms for Spotify's service: the IOS and Android mobile operating systems. Spotify has claimed for years that both Apple and Alphabet have acted anticompetitively by prioritizing their own applications over Spotify's on their respective mobile app stores. Now, governments are starting to agree.Earlier this year, the European Union fined Apple $2 billion for specific anticompetitive behavior against music streaming services (meaning Spotify). Despite Apple and Alphabet both trying to cripple Spotify's business, it continues to thrive. I think that shows how powerful a service it is in consumers' eyes.Spotify has always grown quickly but without generating a profit. Investors soured on the business in 2022 as management once again pushed out profits to future years. Now, it looks like the year of profits is finally arriving.The company has gone through major layoffs after hiring too many people in 2020 and 2021 while also trying to eliminate redundant costs across its business operations. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Spotify would have generated a positive operating profit if you excluded its one-time severance costs.The business keeps growing, even with fewer employees. I think this means profits are probable in 2024. Margins keep moving higher, and revenue is still growing at a double-digit rate (16% year over year in Q4, for example). Over the long term, management expects the business will hit 10% or higher profit margins, given its unit economics. These aren't the sky-high margins you might see at other technology companies, but after 2024, it will be hard to claim that Spotify has an unviable business model.After its massive run-up, Spotify now sports a healthy market capitalization of $50 billion. Assuming it can reach a 10% profit margin in the next few years, its $14.4 billion in revenue would turn into $1.44 billion in earnings. That gives the stock a (theoretical) price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 35, a significant premium to the market average.With Spotify's premium P/E multiple, investors need to expect the company to grow quickly to fulfill its current valuation -- and Spotify is doing just that, with revenue growing at a double-digit rate in 2023. There is still plenty of room for the music streaming market to grow worldwide, with the company making large pushes into podcasts and audiobooks to drive further gains.If Spotify can keep growing revenue at a healthy rate, the stock still looks reasonably valued at these prices. Don't be afraid to buy shares just because it is up over 200% since the start of 2023.Should you invest $1,000 in Spotify Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Spotify Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Spotify Technology wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-21 13:48:00,IBM Eyes First Record Since 2013 as AI Optimism Fuels 19% Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the oldest companies in tech has been quietly trouncing some of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.Most Read from BloombergTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New TeamWhat Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million BondFed to Give Fresh Clues on Path of Interest-Rate CutsUltra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite NeighborhoodSam Bankman-Fried Says 50-Year Sentence Only Suitable for a ‘Super Villain’International Business Machines Corp. recently hit its highest since 2013, putting it about 6% below an all-time high as investors bet that a turnaround is finally bearing fruit after years of tepid growth and share-price returns. Compared to the Magnificent Seven, IBM’s roughly 19% gain this year, including dividends, trails only Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.“IBM has been discounted by the rest of the industry, but it has made a lot of investments in both cloud and AI, and with a strong AI business, we could see growth inflecting higher,” said Jethro Townsend, portfolio manager at Nia Impact Capital. He cites the firm’s cash flow generation and “healthy” dividend yield as factors that provide room for it to re-rate higher.Much of the year’s advance followed IBM’s results in late January, when it gave a better-than-expected forecast for both free cash flow and revenue and said it was seeing growing demand for its AI products. The company has also cut jobs and expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI, which is seen as a potential tailwind for margins.The stock fell 0.3% on Wednesday.The surge is a recent phenomenon, however; while Apple Inc. has lagged this year, its five-year total return of 275% is much stronger than IBM’s 82% gain over the same period.Wall Street remains divided, with bulls outnumbered by skeptics and bears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it looks cheaper relative to most big-tech stocks, IBM’s multiple of 19 times estimated earnings is near its highest in 20 years. Furthermore, the stock is 4% over the average price target, among the worst return potentials among components of the S&P 500 tech index.Still, the company offers something that is something of a rarity among big tech: a robust dividend. The indicated yield is 3.43%, well above others in the sector. The indicated yields for Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are below 1%, and while Nvidia pays a dividend, the yield is essentially non-existent.That hasn’t been enough to entice bulls in the face of IBM’s growth potential, which is expected to remain far below the megacaps. Revenue is expected to grow at a single-digit pace for the next several years, compared with double-digit expansion for other AI-adjacent companies like Microsoft or Alphabet Inc. Its most recent report failed to juice expectations; while the consensus for the company’s net 2024 earnings is up 4.4% over the past quarter, the view for revenue has barely budged, per data compiled by Bloomberg.“The CEO has done a heroic job in starting to turn the company around, but it is just generally slower growth, and not cheap enough to be enticing relative to those more modest prospects,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. “We can easily do better elsewhere.”Tech Chart of the DayIn a measure of how tech continues to be driven by its biggest companies, an index of small-cap tech stocks is down 7% this year as of its last close, making it a dramatic underperformer compared with other size categories. The S&P 500 tech sector index, which tracks large-cap tech stocks, is up 12% in 2024. However, an index of mid-cap tech has done best of all, with a gain of 14%.Top Tech StoriesThe Biden administration is considering blacklisting a number of Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies Co. after the telecom giant notched a significant technological breakthrough last year, people familiar with the matter said.The US will award Intel Corp. $8.5 billion in grants and as much as $11 billion in loans to help fund an expansion of its semiconductor factories, the Commerce Department announced Wednesday, marking the largest award from a program designed to reinvigorate the domestic chip industry.Tencent Holdings Ltd. plans to more than double its stock buyback program to at least $12.8 billion in 2024, mollifying investors concerned about a gradual dissipation of growth during a Chinese economic downturn.Samsung Electronics Co. gained its most in more than six months after Nikkei Asia reported Nvidia Corp. is looking to buy its high-bandwidth memory chips, marking a milestone for Korea’s largest company.PocketHealth Inc. has raised $33 million from new investors including Deloitte Ventures and Samsung Next, joining a growing crop of startups gathering capital to explore the use of AI in healthcare.Earnings Due WednesdayPremarketJinkoSolarKingsoft CloudPostmarketMicron(Updates to market open.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionSelling Shohei Ohtani: Can Baseball’s Biggest Talent Transform the Sport?China’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American BuyersJulius Baer Hits Reboot to Escape Swiss Banking’s New MalaiseOpenAI Sprinting to Keep Up With Startups on AI-Generated Video©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/ibm-eyes-first-record-since-114629010.html,AAPL,0.125,0.021,0.8540000000000001,0.9983,Positive,175.2301025390625,176.51499938964844,0.7332626255237777,1

2024-03-20 18:34:00,Judge denies Apple's attempt to dismiss a class-action lawsuit over AirTag stalking,"NEW YORK (AP) — A judge has denied Apple's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that stalkers are using its AirTag devices to track victims — and that the tech giant hasn't done enough to prevent them.Apple’s $29 AirTags have become popular items since their 2021 release, helping users keep tabs on the location of anything from their lost keys to wallets and luggage. But stalkers have also taken advantage of AirTags and similar products to follow individuals without their consent.In December 2022, Apple was sued by dozens of plaintiffs who said they were stalked by AirTag users. They alleged that Apple failed to mitigate such dangers and should have done more to protect victims — claiming AirTags “revolutionized the scope, breadth, and ease of location-based stalking” and that current safety features are inadequate.Apple attempted to dismiss the litigation in a filing last year, arguing the company “took proactive steps to try to deter misuse” and that it should not bear liability for injuries caused by third parties. But San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria dismissed that motion on Friday.Chhabria ruled that, while most of the class-action plaintiffs' claims were “inadequately pled,"" three can proceed for negligence and strict product liability under California law. The remaining claims were dismissed in a separate order.“Apple may ultimately be right that California law did not require it to do more to diminish the ability of stalkers to use AirTags effectively, but that determination cannot be made at this early stage,"" Chhabria wrote.Chhabria detailed arguments from both Apple and the plaintiffs in the ruling. Included were accounts from the three remaining claims of victims being stalked by former partners or others through AirTags that were allegedly attached to their cars, resulting in emotional and sometimes financial harm.All three of these cases involve “purported defects” of AirTags that made it harder for the victims to both understand the tracking and quickly stop it, Friday's ruling outlines, including unclear or delayed notifications, as well as an inability to disable the devices remotely, which allegedly prolonged stalking.“We’re grateful for the opportunity to continue this critical litigation,” Gillian L. Wade, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, told The Associated Press via email. “Abusive and dangerous location tracking is only becoming more common, so it’s imperative to do everything we can to give voice to the victims, and to push for accountability and change.”Apple and attorneys representing the California-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.Back in February 2022, months ahead of the class action filing, Apple released a statement that said it “condemn(s) in the strongest possible terms any malicious use of our products."" It also noted then-planned updates aimed at increasing safety.Last year, Apple also partnered with Google to submit a proposal aimed at setting standards for combatting secret surveillance on AirTags and similar gadgets.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/judge-denies-apples-attempt-dismiss-183435295.html,AAPL,0.09699999999999999,0.107,0.7959999999999999,-0.6785,Negative,176.47740173339844,176.8300018310547,0.19979900780096324,0
2024-03-20 17:59:00,I was there for the dot-com bust. Here's why the AI boom isn't the same.,"The booming prices of artificial intelligence stocks have some obvious parallels with the dot-com bubble that inflated the stock market to outrageous highs in 1999 and 2000. Parallels that make some investors nervous today.According to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).But as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today’s market isn’t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.How can I say such a thing?It’s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.Back then, besotted people (I wouldn’t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.Why were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn’t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.So people who had bought into the dot-com hype — and there were plenty of them — mostly bought individual stocks.These days, people talk — mistakenly, in my opinion — about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst.One of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That’s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)Two months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced — on Mar. 10, 2000 — the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.Then the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.Ultimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn’t score another new high until April 23, 2015 — more than 15 years after the previous peak.Even one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble — Cisco Systems — hasn’t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.Barring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now? I sure can’t see that happening. Especially given the trillions of dollars currently sloshing around in S&P index funds, with more money flowing in on a regular basis from employers and employees participating in benefit plans and from institutional investors such as pension funds for whom the S&P is a benchmark.But, you say, what about the Magnificent Seven tech companies whose stocks more than doubled last year and drove the S&P to new high after new high?The S&P’s total return — price increases plus reinvested dividends — for the year was 26.3%. Doesn’t this mean that we’re in a bubble?I don’t think so. Among the reasons is that even though the Seven were incredibly hot, the other S&P companies — let’s call them the Non-Magnificent 493 — had a total return of 9.9%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s about the average return the US market has shown over the long term.Amazingly, this year’s market, despite a recent decline, is on track to outperform last year’s market. The S&P had returned 7.28% through Friday’s close, according to Silverblatt. Extrapolate that 2.5-month return to a full year and you get 34.9%.And now, some of last year’s Magnificent Seven are having a less-than-magnificent 2024. Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday’s close — the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.Nvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P’s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)The point here is that it doesn’t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren’t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.Look. I’m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days — it’s not cheap by any standard. And I’m not telling you that it’s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.But what I am telling you is that there’s a big difference between a high-priced market like today’s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.There may be some difficult times ahead for investors. But a decline of almost 80% over the next two and a half years? As we say in the part of the world in which I live: fuhgeddaboudit.Allan Sloan is an award-winning journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/i-was-there-for-the-dot-com-bust-heres-why-the-ai-boom-isnt-the-same-175944680.html,AAPL,0.086,0.04,0.8740000000000001,0.9936,Positive,176.11500549316406,176.63999938964844,0.29809719791579753,0

2024-03-20 16:46:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) Aids YouTube Music With Song Search Feature,"Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is leaving no stone unturned to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the music streaming market space. Per a Grand View Research report, the global music streaming market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.In this regard, the company added a song search capability for YouTube Music on Android devices.Notably, YouTube Music now features a dedicated button next to voice search, allowing faster access by tapping the search icon in the top-right corner.Alphabet is likely to expand its YouTube Music subscriber base on the back of its latest move.Alphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteApart from the song search feature, Google introduced a ""Trim Silence"" feature in the v6.43.52 version of YouTube Music, allowing users to skip past stretches of silence in a podcast, resulting in a slightly shorter runtime.Further, the company announced a redesign of the Now Playing feature on YouTube Music for web, introducing a full-screen experience with a Song and Video switcher, minimize button, overflow menu and cast controls.Additionally, Google added several new notifications for YouTube Music on Android and iOS, alerting users about new releases and playlists.These notifications include music recommendation notifications, playlist update notifications, podcast recommendation notifications, product update notifications and recap notifications. Users can disable these notifications in their preferences at any time.All the above-mentioned endeavors to enhance YouTube Music offerings will likely aid Alphabet to bolster its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth driver for the company. Its shares have rallied 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 44.6%.The strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.52 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.Growing YouTube Music efforts will likely allow Alphabet to strengthen its competitive position against rivals like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN, which are also making substantial efforts to strengthen their footing in the global music streaming space.Recently, Apple offered USHER fans exclusive content on Apple Music ahead of his upcoming Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show. The content includes a trailer, studio album discography, playlists curated by USHER and NFL teams, and dedicated Apple Music Radio programming for Apple Music subscribers.Apple also launched a Discovery Station for Apple Music.

2024-03-20 14:07:00,Prediction: Nvidia Will Become the World's Largest Company. Here's Why.,"Let's cut right to the chase: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on track to become the world's largest company. Think that's going too far? I don't. Here's why.As of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest American company, behind only Microsoft and Apple.Company NameSymbolMarket Cap (in billions)MicrosoftMSFT$3,094AppleAAPL$2,665NvidiaNVDA$2,195AmazonAMZN$1,811AlphabetGOOG$1,761That puts it 'only' $500 billion behind Apple and about $1 trillion behind Microsoft. To put it another way, Nvidia could surpass Apple if its stock were to rally by 23%; it could pass Microsoft if it rallied by 46%.Why do I think this will happen? Two words come to mind: Artificial Intelligence (AI). In short, the world has gone head-over-heels for AI. Consider this chart below:According to Statista, the overall Generative AI market stood at $44.9 billion in 2023. By 2030, that figure is expected to rise to $207 billion. Generative AI, which can create images, stories, music, and video, is already upending entire industries. Marketing, software design, and customer service are just a few sectors likely to be transformed over the next decade as generative AI products grow in popularity.In short, Nvidia stands to profit from the AI revolution more than any other company, thanks to its leading share of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) market. GPUs are the 'brains' behind cutting-edge AI applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney. And to build those brains, companies like OpenAI need tens of thousands of GPUs -- often designed by Nvidia.To sum up, thanks to its commanding place in the GPU market, I think Nvidia can ride the AI wave to the top of the list of most valuable companies in the world.

INVESTORS ‘DEEPLY FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY,’ FORMER INSIDER WARNSThe firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance.But the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google alleging it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its search dominance.GOOGLE RELEASES NEW GEMINI UPDATE TO GIVE USERS ‘MORE CONTROL’ OVER AI CHATBOT RESPONSESApple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the iPhone maker was investing ""significantly"" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year.The Bloomberg report said Apple was planning to use its own homegrown AI models for some new capabilities in its upcoming iOS 18, but was seeking a partner to power genAI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts.Reuters contributed to this report.Original article source: Apple, Google in talks for Gemini to power iPhone AI features: report",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-google-talks-gemini-power-192652851.html,AAPL,0.109,0.068,0.8240000000000001,0.9184,Positive,174.97000122070312,176.25,0.7315532779143746,1

2024-03-19 17:28:00,Alphabet Stock Is Soaring Today: Is It a Buy on Potential Apple News?,"Investors were delighted with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock this morning after a report that the company was in talks with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to make its Gemini AI chatbot available on the iPhone.Although talks are ongoing and no deal has been announced, the report led to a surge in Alphabet shares on Monday as investors seemed to believe it was a sign that the company was overcoming the negative publicity and other challenges that have been associated with its AI technology thus far. As of noon ET today, the stock had gained as much as 7.8%, approaching an all-time high, while Apple was up as much as 3%.Today's gain was no small move for Alphabet, which had added more than $100 billion in market cap at one point based on the report. But investors should be aware that the news has not been confirmed at this point.Bloomberg reported this morning that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for some new additions to the iPhone software later this year, though it's unlikely that a deal would be announced until June, when Apple holds its annual developer conference.Apple has also held talks with OpenAI about using its generative AI model, so it's unclear if an agreement between Apple and Alphabet will be finalized.Given the uncertainty in the partnership, the news isn't a game changer for Alphabet. But a tie-up with Apple would certainly be a big step in the right direction for the Google parent, which has stumbled with its AI strategy thus far after Bard flopped in its launch and the rebranded Gemini chatbot has faced criticism as well.Alphabet has already announced a partnership with Samsung to include its generative AI technology on its newest Galaxy phones, showing that the chatbot technology is gaining adoption.For now, the new AI technology is unlikely to be a major revenue driver for Alphabet, but establishing relationships that could become entrenched for decades is important. Keep an eye out for more news on the arrangement between the two tech leaders since it's likely to move Alphabet stock in the future.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-19 16:30:00,Wall Street Analyst Warns Apple Stock Could Get 'Killed' And 'Would Not Be Surprised If Buffett Is Selling Right Now',"It's been a terrible year so far for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors, with the company's share price down about 7% year to date, compared to the roughly 9% gain the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced during the same period.Commonly cited reasons for the disappointing start to the year have been fears of lower demand in China, potentially falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, regulatory pressures and low growth.Jordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, sees another major risk on the horizon, warning that things could get worse for Apple.Don't Miss:US military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here’s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.Klein said he ""would not be surprised if [Buffett] is selling right now"" and that Buffett ""knows when that 13F comes out showing he started to sell, that [Apple] shares will get killed as retail investors rush for the exit.""Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK) most recent 13F disclosed that Buffett sold some of his Apple stock, albeit a marginal 1% of his massive position.News of Berkshire Hathaway selling more shares could put pressure on the stock given that the company owns 5.9% of all outstanding Apple shares, representing 42.8% of its entire stock portfolio.While Buffett has said that his ""favorite holding period is forever,"" Berkshire's portfolio has experienced turnover lately.Trending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.In addition to trimming its Apple stock, Berkshire exited its positions in StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), and D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) as well as significantly trimming its stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA).The D.R Horton stake in particular was built up as recently as the second quarter of last year.Klein sees the stock as likely to lag the market until the company shares more about its AI plans, which he speculates might come as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) developer event.Dan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, deems the situation a strong buying opportunity, giving Apple's stock a price target of $250 per share. He cites massive pent-up demand in the iPhone upgrade cycle and high expectations of ""AI finally coming to Cupertino (in California).""For long-term investors in Apple, it's paid to ignore short-term worries and stay the course. In the past five years, the stock has seen a more than 267% gain. Meanwhile, investors fortunate enough to have bought and held since its 1984 initial public offering (IPO) would be sitting on an over 142,000% gain.The 13Fs are due within 45 days of a quarter ending, so investors waiting for the next updates on Berkshire’s portfolio will likely need to wait until mid-May.Read More on Startup Investing:WealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.New homebuilding startup could be in the right place at the right time to shock real estate market – and it sells for $5 per share.""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Wall Street Analyst Warns Apple Stock Could Get 'Killed' And 'Would Not Be Surprised If Buffett Is Selling Right Now' originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

2024-03-19 15:48:00,Why Alphabet Stock Rallied Monday Morning,"Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) charged higher Monday, gaining as much as 7.8%. As of 10:49 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 7.1%.The catalyst that sent the tech giant higher was reporting that the company may have found its first big licensee for its artificial intelligence (AI) services.Alphabet is reportedly ""in active negotiations"" with Apple to license Google's Gemini to underpin certain AI-powered features in the iPhone, according to a story first reported by Bloomberg. The company may go so far as to integrate Alphabet's suite of AI tools into the device itself, according to the report, which cited ""people familiar with the situation.""If the deal comes to pass, it would be the first clear indication that Alphabet has a market for its AI services beyond its cloud infrastructure offering, Google Cloud. Any such deal would extend an existing partnership between the pair, as Apple offers Google as the default search engine within its Safari web browser.It's still early days for generative AI, and it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Just last month, Alphabet temporarily suspended Gemini's image generation capabilities when it produced inaccurate representations of historical figures. Google took the features offline and apologized, saying: ""Gemini image generation got it wrong. We'll do better."" This helps to illustrate that even the most advanced generative AI models are still a work in progress.Investors have questioned Alphabet's ability to capitalize on the AI opportunity and this is the first sure sign it's headed in the right direction. And the opportunity ahead is vast, though estimates span a wide range. Generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That said, Alphabet is still a relative bargain, selling for 26 times earnings, a discount compared to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500. A rebound in the digital advertising market -- Alphabet's bread and butter -- is ongoing, and the potential to profit from AI is significant.Now is the time to buy Alphabet stock before this fire sale is over.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-19 15:47:00,Looks like Apple will need a partner to go all in on generative AI—but big antitrust issues await,"Apple-watchers will have noted the company’s recent progression from “We’ve deployed machine learning for years and are too sui generis to talk about ‘AI’” to “We have a lot of AI stuff coming soon, honest!” But with Apple being way behind in the generative AI race it has now deigned to join, how will it catch up?According to a Bloomberg report his morning, the answer lies in partnerships—at least, for what the publication calls the “heavy lifting of generative AI,” as opposed to the on-device AI action that would presumably/hopefully power a smarter Siri. It seems Apple has considered using OpenAI’s models for image generation and the like, but “active negotiations” with Gemini proprietor Google are underway.Of course, Apple and Google have already had a close partnership for nearly two decades, around making Google the default search engine in Safari. That bond is now being frayed by pressure from antitrust regulators in the U.S. (where the Justice Department has sued Google for paying Apple and others billions of dollars to make it the search default) and in Europe (where the new Digital Markets Act has forced Apple to prompt iOS Safari users to choose which search engine they want as their default).As Bloomberg notes, a new AI deal could “help make up for” the falling value of Google and Apple’s search agreement—but it could also increase antitrust scrutiny for both companies. After all, the smartphone operating system market is essentially divided between the two companies, so having the same AI garnish on both Android and iOS could raise questions.What if Apple opts for OpenAI instead? Here, Microsoft enters into the equation. On the one hand, Microsoft’s patronage of OpenAI is also under antitrust scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, so an OpenAI-Apple deal could be quite useful in demonstrating that Sam Altman’s company is not effectively a Microsoft unit. But can you imagine if the deal were to extend to MacOS? Then the whole desktop operating system market would be powered by the same large language model.Perhaps a more durable solution would be for Apple to partner with an AI company like Anthropic or Mistral, where the potential antitrust pitfalls aren’t quite so predictable. Or maybe Apple can get its act together on developing its own models into a competitive option.Incidentally, while on the subject, there’s a new report out that says OpenAI’s models have developed prejudices against speakers of African American English, “exhibiting covert stereotypes that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded, although closest to the ones from before the civil rights movement… Language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of African American English be assigned less prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes, and be sentenced to death.”Apple won’t be using AI for such life-changing (or life-ending) decisions, but still, my advice would be to tread really carefully when deciding which models to use, and how to use them.

2024-03-19 15:38:00,Apple is reportedly exploring a partnership with Google for Gemini-powered feature on iPhones,"Apple is looking to team up with Google for a mega-deal to leverage the Gemini AI model for features on iPhone, Bloomberg reported. This will put Google in a commanding position as the company already has a deal with Apple as the preferred search engine provider on iPhones for the Safari browser.The publication cited people familiar with the matter saying that Apple is looking to license Google's AI tech to introduce AI-powered features with iOS updates later this year. Additionally, the company also held discussions with OpenAI to potentially use GPT models, Bloomberg said.There is surmounting pressure on Apple to catch up with competitors in the AI field such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic and even Google. In February, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company will introduce GenAI features ""later this year.""The company's job listings over the last year have suggested that Apple is working on multiple internal and external tools powered by generative AI. However, talks of leveraging third-party AI tech means Apple hasn't progressed as expected in its own AI efforts.Apple's own models might power some of the on-device features on the upcoming iOS 18 software update — expected to be announced at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) historically held in June. However, the company is exploring partnering with an external provider for generative AI use cases such as image creation and helping users with writing.Google has had its own set of problems with Gemini. Last month, the company had to pause its image-generation feature after the model created images with historical inaccuracies. Later, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that Gemini's responses were ""completely unacceptable."" Last week, Google said that it is blocking election-related queries on Gemini across the globe. But TechCrunch found that users could get around those restrictions by introducing typos to some queries.Despite these fallbacks, Google has an advantage in launching smartphone-related features. Earlier this year, the company partnered with Samsung to introduce Gemini-powered AI features on the Galaxy S24 series of devices. The search giant has also launched these features on its own Pixel series of phones.We have reached out to Apple and Google for a comment, and we will update the story if we hear back from them.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/17/apple-is-reportedly-exploring-a-partnership-with-google-for-gemini-powered-feature-on-iphones/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-reportedly-exploring-partnership-google-061906606.html,AAPL,0.028999999999999998,0.019,0.9520000000000001,0.1664,Neutral,176.625,175.2550048828125,-0.7756518710191083,-1

This is according to a report from Bloomberg. This comes after Apple also reportedly held conversations with OpenAI to use its product. For more on what this could mean for the tech giants and the broader industry, we want to bring in Martin Yang. He's Oppenheimer's senior analyst of emerging technologies and services. Martin, it's good to see you. So just first, your reaction to this report, and if it's true, how big of a deal this is for Apple?MARTIN YANG: This is a very big deal for Apple because it removes the near-term concern that Apple cannot implement any GenAI functions on iPhone due to its lack of infrastructure investments relative to other large tech companies. And then, I think, it positions the iPhone, at least in the near-term, to be the go-to device to interact with large language models.BRAD SMITH: And so additionally, Martin, when you think about the fact that Google Alphabet is going to pick up a potential win on this as well, I mean, what is it going to take for this to be successful as both of these companies would want it to be?MARTIN YANG: I think it will require a lot of nuance on how the large language models or GenAI functions will be implemented because it can augment search capabilities, but there are also a large number of applications they can use. One example will be a similar implementation to Copilot for the productivity functions-- productivity applications from Apple similar to Microsoft implementation of Copilot for Office suite.SEANA SMITH: Martin, what does it tell us, though, about Apple's internal efforts, because there has been some optimism, some chatter, especially over the last couple of weeks, just about what they are doing and how much they are investing in their own AI efforts? Is that maybe not as far as some had anticipated it was up until this point?MARTIN YANG: Right. We believe that there's a ketchup Apple needs to do to build up its own infrastructure to train large language models because the short supply of GPU cards from NVIDIA. And in the-- maybe in the near-term, I think, there's a way for Apple to implement on-device AIs using Apple Silicon, but those are not the equivalent of OpenAI's GPT-4 or Gemini in the near-term.BRAD SMITH: Martin, do you think about what generative AI could be for the next supercycle for iPhones and for Apple specifically? What type of material difference are you expecting as consumers try to get their hands on the latest cutting-edge technology there?MARTIN YANG: Sure, I think there are a couple of ways for us to get excited about the next generation iPhone with more capable AI functions. Number one will be Siri becomes real, really helpful to the users. Right now, it's really handicapped, and by-- Siri right now is referring to, telling us about weather, telling us our time, setting timers.And I think the next iteration of Siri augmented by AI could be becomes really helpful as an agent will help us navigate through multiple apps and then getting a real bookings for hotels, reservations, and restaurants, and then getting us really a real-world applications of things we could do with iPhones, you know, where the interface becomes voice and as opposed to touch and other controls.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/beyond-google-talks-apple-needs-152603132.html,AAPL,0.07400000000000001,0.004,0.922,0.9944,Positive,176.83509826660156,174.77499389648438,-1.1649861313229324,-1
2024-03-19 15:06:00,"Apple in talks to let Google's Gemini power iPhone AI features, Bloomberg News says","By Martin Coulter(Reuters) -Apple is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.The negotiations are about licensing Gemini for some new features coming to the iPhone software this year, the report said, adding that the terms or branding of an AI agreement or how it would be implemented have not been decided.Alphabet shares jumped more than 6% in early U.S. trading, while Apple was up 2.5%.It is unlikely that any deal would be announced until June, when Apple plans to hold its annual conference of developers, and the iPhone maker also recently held talks with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI about using its model, according to the report.Apple, Alphabet-owned Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.A potential deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.It could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year.The firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance.But the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google on grounds that it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its monopoly in search.""This strategic partnership is a missing piece in the Apple AI strategy and combines forces with Google for Gemini to power some of the AI features Apple is bringing to market,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush.""This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major licence fee attached to this,"" he said, referring to Apple's California headquarters.Google in January partnered with Apple's rival Samsung to deploy its genAI technology in the South Korean firm's Galaxy S24 series of smartphones, as part of its efforts to boost the use of Gemini after some missteps during its roll-out.Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the company was investing ""significantly"" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year.The Bloomberg report said Apple was planning to use its own homegrown AI models for some new capabilities in its upcoming iOS 18, but was seeking a partner to power genAI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts.(Reporting by Jahnavi Nidumolu and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Janane Venkatraman, Varun H K and Susan Fenton)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-talks-let-googles-gemini-054341739.html,AAPL,0.066,0.024,0.9109999999999999,0.9423,Positive,176.8300018310547,175.16000366210938,-0.9444088399325171,-1

2024-03-19 14:00:00,Examining Buffett's 'Indefinite' Stocks,"To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What's needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework."" - Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PRGO.In his recent letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholders, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) identified three stocks as well as five Japanese companies which the conglomerate intends to hold ""indefinitely."" This is close enough to ""forever"" as far as I am concerned for the purpose of this discussion. The reason is these companies are hugely successful in their base businesses, are enduring, scalable and leave him feeling ""comfortable."" The last point is an important if underappreciated quality in choosing stocks to own. You want to avoid investments that cause you stress and keep you up at night. This discussion explores these Buffett ""forever"" stocks using GuruFocus data and I offer my opinion if they are still worth buying at current prices.Additionally, as he recalled Charlie Munger advising him, after he took control of Berkshire and relocated it from New England to Omaha, that he should forget about ""owning fair stocks at wonderful prices,"" but focus on ""owning wonderful stocks at fair prices."" I think we can be certain these businesses are wonderful as Berkshire owns them, but are the prices still ""fair?"" And if so, does it make sense to still buy them?The first company Buffett identified is Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO). GuruFocus data shows the stock to be modestly undervalued and fits with Munger's definition of a wonderful business at a fair price.Buffett mentioned in his letter that Coca-Cola was launched in an Atlanta drug store in 1886, quipping that Berkshire is not big on newcomers.Coca-Cola is a business with high predictability and low capital intensity. It is global in its scope. People are used to drinking its products and are expected to keep on consuming them for decades to come. Drinking carbonated beverages is unlikely to go out of fashion. Technological disruptions such as artificial intelligence do not fundamentally threaten the business, but can enhance it. The company's return on invested capital consistently exceeds its weighted average cost of capital. Berkshire owns about 9% of Coke's outstanding shares.Overall, I think Coca-Cola is still a buy. It is a ""sleep well at night"" stock that will continue compounding in the future.The GF Value chart shows American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) to be fairly valued after the recent surge of over 58% from its October 2023 lows. American Express is a great company that Buffett has owned for decades. Its ROIC consistently exceeds its WACC.Founded in 1850, American Express is known principally for its charge cards but also extends credit and provides a suite of related services to businesses and merchants. The company is positioned at the higher end of the card business. Despite the competitive nature of the industry, it has averaged about 10% earnings per share growth over many years, through above-average revenue growth and ongoing share buybacks.Overall, I think American Express is a weak buy if you do not already own it. If you own it, I think it is best to wait for a more opportunistic entry point to buy more. It is a proven compounder of shareholder capital and though right now its not a bargain, buying it now is unlikely to cause regret in the future. However, be aware that the best opportunity to buy American Express happens when the fear of a recession is in the air like last year. With a booming economy like at present, American Express is on the expensive side. Berkshire owns more than 20% of its stock.Buffett said, ""The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""Berkshire owns 27.80% of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) shares as well as holds options to increase its stake further, but Buffett emphasized that he has no desire to own the company outright. The guru likes Occidental's vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of the latter technique has yet to be proven. However, clearly it will be needed in the future due to the inevitability of climate change and societal pressure to do something about it. Both of these activities, he said, are very much in the country's interest, giving the investment a patriotic flavor. Buffett likes the fact that Occidental's holdings are in the U.S. (thus safe from a geopolitical turbulence) and very much needed to maintain U.S. energy independence from foreign oil, which he sees as a risk to the country. Thus, his holdings in Occidental somewhat of a hedge against global conflict and turbulence.Occidental looks modestly overvalued according to the GF Value Line. However, I think we should look at the stock from the lens Buffett is using that it is a domestic oil and gas major, and thus much safer than other large multinational oil and gas companies with comparable reserves outside the U.S. Further, like all oil and gas companies, it is very cyclical.Buffett is a multibillionaire and is not bothered by volatility. However, most investors are not multibillionaires, so factor that in. All in all, I would wait for a better entry point.Berkshire currently holds approximately 9% ownership in each of five Japanese companies. Buffett said in his letter that Berkshire has made a commitment to these companies that it will not acquire shares exceeding a 9.90% stake. The total cost of these holdings amounts to 1.60 trillion yen ($10.75 billion), while the year-end market value stands at 2.90 trillion yen. However, due to the yen's recent weakening, Berkshire's unrealized gain in dollars reached 61%, equivalent to $8 billion.These companies are often referred to as Sogo-Shosha, which translates to ""general trading companies,"" and form a crucial part of the Japanese economy. However, they have greatly evolved from their trading roots and are now conglomerates of many trading, real estate and industrial businesses.The first is Itochu Corp. (TSE:8001), a diversified conglomerate with interests spanning various sectors. Historically, it played a crucial role in importing energy, minerals and food into Japan. Today, its portfolio extends beyond trade activities to include logistics, real estate, frozen foods and even investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy.Next is Marubeni Corp. (TSE:8002), another significant player in Japan's trading landscape. Like its peers, it has a diverse portfolio, including energy, agriculture and infrastructure. The company has adapted to changing market dynamics and expanded into non-trade areas such as real estate and aerospace.Third, Mitsubishi Corp. (TSE:8058) has a rich history and has been instrumental in Japan's economic development. Traditionally, it focused on importing raw materials and exporting finished products. Today, the company's interests span various industries, including automotive, machinery and finance. It has also ventured into newer areas like EVs and renewable energy.Mitsui & Co. Ltd. (TSE:8031) is one of the oldest sogo-shosha companies, with its roots tracing back to the Edo period. Over time, it has diversified its business lines, including investments in infrastructure, chemicals and health care. Mitsui's very long-term approach aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy.Last but not least is Sumitomo Corp. (TSE:8053). It has a storied history dating back centuries. The company has been involved in copper mining, banking and trade. In recent years, Sumitomo has expanded into diverse sectors, such as real estate, logistics and telecommunications. Its focus on value and cash flow resonates with Buffett's investment principles.The table below provides a snapshot of these companies basic fundamentals:TickerCompanyCurrent Price (Yen)Market Cap($M)EV-to-EBITDAPE RatioFCF Yield %DividendYield %TSE:8001Itochu Corp6,38562,439.738.3212.717.862.43TSE:8031Mitsui & Co Ltd6,52266,234.077.419.758.752.45TSE:8058Mitsubishi Corp3,23590,633.058.5314.957.472.14TSE:8053Sumitomo Corp3,46228,690.407.928.429.933.47TSE:8002Marubeni Corp2,43427,650.447.249.148.073.37Since Buffett purchased the five companies about three years ago, they are up substantially in yen terms and even more in U.S. dollar terms as the yen has weakened. The following chart shows the price appreciation over the last three years.While the five companies may not be household names globally, they play critical roles in Japan's economic landscape, which is similar to the role Berkshire plays in the U.S. Buffett's interest in these Japanese companies reflects their stability, diversified portfolios and long-term vision. He appreciates their similarities to Berkshire Hathaway, emphasizing value and understanding the businesses they operate.Buffett said in his letter that because he cannot accurately forecast major currency market prices, Berkshire had financed a significant portion of its Japanese stock position using the proceeds from 1.30 trillion yen in bond sales. This debt issue has been well-received in Japan, and Berkshire likely holds more yen-denominated debt than any other American company. The weakened yen since then has resulted in a year-end gain of $1.90 billion for Berkshire, which, in accordance with GAAP rules, has been recognized in income over the 2020 to 2023 period. Thus, not only have the stock prices of the Japanese companies gone up substantially, but the debt Berkshire took on has diminished in U.S. dollar terms, resulting in a one-two punch in favor of Berkshire.Buffett said in his letter that all five Japanese companies adhere to shareholder-friendly policies that surpass typical U.S. practices. Since Berkshire initiated its purchases, each of these companies has reduced their outstanding shares at attractive prices. Additionally, he says, their management teams exhibit ""less aggressiveness"" regarding compensating themselves compared to U.S. norms. Furthermore, each allocates only about one-third of its earnings to dividends, retaining substantial sums for business expansion and share repurchases. Like Berkshire, these companies are cautious about issuing new shares. From the tone of the letter, it looks like Buffett is really pleased with his ownership of the Japanese sogo-soshas and are companies he intends to hold indefinitely.Buffett had surprisingly little to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his letter, given the extremely large part of Berkshire's portfolio invested in the stock. Apple now constitutes over 50% of Berkshire's non-controlled equity investment portfolio. It own 5.86% of Apple's outstanding shares.The tech giant looks fairly valued on the GF Value Line. I don't think we can go wrong with Apple at the present time given its dominance in mobile tech and wide competitive moat.Another stock is Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), which is Buffett's second-highest conviction stock after Apple and over 10% of his portfolio is in it. Berkshire owns about 13% of the bank's outstanding stock. It is also in fairly valued territory.So that's it folks. These are Buffett's ""indefinite hold"" or ""close enough to forever"" stocks gleaned from his latest letter. At present, I think only Coca-Cola is a clear buy and the rest are weak buys. I like Apple and if it comes down a bit more, I may take the plunge.Buffett's Japanese investments are very interesting, but I would rather hold them indirectly through my ownership of Berkshire stock to avoid the foreign exchange risk. The purchase of the five conglomerates was a master stroke. It is interesting to note that while Buffett has been building up his Japanese exposure, he has been reducing his Chinese and Taiwanese exposure. He has been selling down his BYD (SZSE:002594) position and has exited his Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) position. While he did not disclose a reason, I think it may be because of geopolitical concerns.The guru's approach is pretty much safety first and very long-term thinking. Watching his portfolio is like watching paint dry. Like he says, the first rule of investing is not to lose money and the second rule is to see the first rule. It is very interesting to see this philosophy in action with his biggest holdings.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/examining-buffetts-indefinite-stocks-140002079.html,AAPL,0.165,0.040999999999999995,0.795,0.9998,Positive,176.72000122070312,174.59500122070312,-1.202467171413222,-1
2024-03-19 13:46:00,AI in iPhones? Apple in talks with Google,"Apple (AAPL) is in talks with Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to potentially incorporate Google's ""Gemini"" generative AI engine into its iPhones, according to a Bloomberg report. Apple had previously engaged in talks with OpenAI for a similar potential partnership.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Brad Smith discuss past deals between Apple and Google, and how generative AI may be embedded in the devices.more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith- All right. Well, Apple reportedly in talks with Google to use its generative AI engine Gemini on its iPhones. This is according to a report from Bloomberg. Now, this comes after Apple also reportedly held conversations with OpenAI to use its product.Now, this is huge news within the AI space, really within the tech space more broadly here, Brad. If in fact this partnership does go through, it really totally would shake up the AI world. A couple of things, though to bring up. Obviously, a partnership here with Apple and Google, it would be a huge advantage for Google.You're getting access, you're getting exposure to the number of users that Apple has. But it also brings up the fact that, hey, maybe Apple isn't as advanced as many thought that they might have been potentially up until this point on some of their AI efforts. So you've got to also question what this could mean for AI and-- for Apple, excuse me, and their AI plans more broadly speaking in the longer run.- Yeah. Putting generative AI at the fingertips of those two billion devices that are out in the market for Apple iPhones here. And it's important to also note that these companies have had deals in the past, whether that's for search on the iPhones. We do know that Google is the default search engine.And then you can go in and kind of download your other search engines as well, whatever you would like to use on most of these devices. But this is really critical, I think, for how the data sharing as well across both of these companies would move forward. Because you do have a trove of data that would be indexed as you would perceive for any generative AI type of Copilot or tool that would be embedded within it or if it's just embedded within some of the existing operating systems and apps that are on there.I don't know how they're going to go about doing this. But it's another reason for me to perhaps delay upgrading my iPhone, which we've already-- you've seen my cracked screen every day. At this juncture, I'm just waiting for the next generative AI major announcement to come forward so that I know that that's the device that I have to get into here.- Yeah, exactly. And I think a lot of people are out there scratching their heads trying to figure out exactly what this means, what the technology is going to behold, whether or not they should be staying on the sidelines and waiting for these new applications and what exactly that would then enable some of these iPhones to do. But real quick, just looking at this early, reaction that we're getting from some analysts out there.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives saying that this strategic partnership is a missing piece in the Apple AI strategy. It's a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem. Similar to what we were talking about just a second ago there, Brad.And then Melius Research was also saying that this news represents a bigger immediate win for Apple who can use that asset light approach to aspects of its AI strategy, and then therefore potentially acquire another form of overall traffic acquisition payments there. So they're viewing it as a huge win here for Apple and for Alphabet. And then that's a big reason why we're seeing both of these stocks move to the upside here in pre-market trading.- Yeah, huge move for Alphabet.

But one of its core technologies is making artificial intelligence systems smaller and faster. That work that could be helpful to Apple, which is focused on running AI on devices rather than entirely in the cloud.Alexander Wong, an AI researcher at the University of Waterloo who helped build the business, has joined Apple as a director in its AI group as part of the deal.In response to questions about the deal, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it “buys smaller technology companies from time to time” but doesn’t discuss its plans.Apple shares briefly gained on the news, rising more than 1% to $173.37. It was trading at $172.92 as of 1:29 p.m. in New York, down about 10% for the year.Waterloo, Ontario-based DarwinAI had raised more than $15 million as of 2022, according to the Canadian startup community Communitech. It received investments from Honeywell Ventures and Inovia Capital, among other venture capital firms. The startup also has worked with companies like Lockheed Martin Corp. and Intel Corp., according to Communitech.The under-the-radar acquisition comes ahead of a big AI push for Apple this year. The company is adding features to its iOS 18 software that rely on generative AI, the technology behind ChatGPT and other groundbreaking tools. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple will “break new ground” in AI this year, and an announcement is expected as soon as the company’s worldwide developers conference in June.Despite having acquired more AI companies than most rivals over the past decade, Apple has fallen behind in the generative AI market. It was caught flat-footed by the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022, and tech peers like Google and Microsoft Corp. have stolen the spotlight with new features.Read More: Apple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft’s GitHub CopilotInternally, Apple has started integrating generative AI into its operations, using the technology to assist with customer service requests.

2024-03-15 13:33:00,"Apple Stock Has 31% Upside, According to This Wall Street Analyst","After climbing 48% in 2023, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed so far in 2024. The stock is down about 11% year to date, in part, due to worries regarding slowing iPhone sales in China. However, one Wall Street analyst sees this price dip as a buying opportunity.Earlier this week, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan renewed his $225 price target on the stock. That price target represents a potential upside of about 31% in the next 12 months or so over the current share price of $171.A recent report from Counterpoint Research showed that iPhone sales in China fell 24% year over year in the first six weeks of the year. This seems to be what is weighing on the stock right now, but Mohan noted that Apple has an important option for dealing with this.Apple does an effective job of lowering the prices of its older phones to maintain steady demand, according to Mohan. The analyst also says Apple's long-term trend of shifting customers toward higher-value units can help offset weak sales in China. China generated 21% of Apple's operating profit last quarter.China sales are getting the blame for the stock's recent performance, but the shares were due for a correction. The stock traded at a high price-to-earnings ratio of 32 at the end of 2023 and now trade at a more reasonable P/E of 27, which is still higher than the market average.Despite weakness in China, Apple's earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter, mostly driven by growing revenue in the higher-margin services category, and the company's ongoing share repurchases.It might take a while for the market to come around, but Apple has plenty of strengths outside of China to deliver returns to investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-15 13:30:00,Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Apple (AAPL): Should You Buy?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.Check price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is AAPL Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.55.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-14 18:33:00,"UPDATE 2-Epic Games says Apple violated App Store injunction, seeks contempt order","(Adds Apple comments, Europe developments, case citation, byline)By Jonathan StempelMarch 13 (Reuters) - Epic Games, which makes the popular video game ""Fortnite,"" on Wednesday accused Apple of violating an injunction governing its lucrative App Store, and asked a U.S. judge to hold Apple in contempt and end its ""sham"" compliance.The companies have been battling in court since 2020, when Epic accused Apple of violating antitrust law by requiring consumers to obtain apps through its App Store, where it charges app developers up to 30% commissions on in-app purchases.A September 2021 injunction by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, let developers provide links and buttons that direct consumers to other means to pay for digital content.In a filing with the California court, Epic alleged that Apple is in ""blatant violation"" of that injunction, despite the Cupertino, California-based company's assurance in a Jan. 16 court notice that it had ""fully complied.""Epic said Apple has imposed new rules and a new 27% fee on developers for some purchases, which taken together make the links ""commercially unusable.""The Cary, North Carolina-based developer also said Apple continues to ""categorically prohibit"" buttons, and still forbids some apps from telling users they have other purchasing options.""Apple's goal is clear: to prevent purchasing alternatives from constraining the supracompetitive fees it collects on purchases of digital goods and services,"" Epic said. ""Apple's so-called compliance is a sham.""In response to requests for comment, Apple referred to its Jan. 16 notice, where it said the injunction would protect consumers and ""the integrity of Apple's ecosystem,"" while ensuring that developers do not get a free ride on its platform.Apple has until April 3 to formally respond to Epic's filing.Last week, Apple briefly escalated the feud by blocking Epic from launching its own online marketplace on iPhones and iPads in Europe, before backing down two days later.In January, the U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear Epic's appeal of lower court findings that Apple's policies did not violate federal antitrust law. The court also decided against hearing Apple's own appeal from the injunction.The case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-05640.

2024-03-14 16:09:00,Corporate dividends reach $1.66T in 2023: Report,"A report from the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index revealed that global corporate dividends reached an all-time high of $1.66 trillion in 2023. Notably, 86% of businesses worldwide increased or maintained their dividend payouts during the year— with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) being the world's top three dividend payers.Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills and Seana Smith break down the details.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Angel SmithMADISON MILLS: We're also going to talk about dividends because global corporate dividends hit a new high of $1.66 trillion last year, with banks making up half of that. Worldwide, 86% of listed companies either increased or maintained their dividends. That's all according to a quarterly report done by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index.And it's just really interesting seeing this new record of $1.72 trillion in dividend payouts this year. This was such a big deal that it contributed to the jobs report. We saw that personal income.At least 4 percentage points of that was attributed to the rise in dividends. So it paints to this broader picture of how we're continuing to see a correlation between market performance and the strength that we're seeing in consumer spending in the overall economy.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. The strong, healthy corporate balance sheets really here front and center, and that's a big driver of the dividend action that we have seen. You mentioned, Maddie, what we were seeing globally, even here within the US. Very impressive numbers.$602.1 billion in total was handed back to shareholders last year through dividends. That was up 5%. Microsoft in the top spot here, the largest dividend payer last year, handing out more than $20 billion in cash to shareholders, followed closely by Apple. Apple was in the number two spot.But you're talking about what lies ahead here for 2024. And like you were saying, $1.72 trillion on a global basis is expected to be paid out, another 5% jump. So that also is very similar to some of the calls that we have gotten from others on the Street.S&P Global was also out predicting another record level of dividend growth in 2024 when they're looking for another 4% increase globally, 6% here within the US. So this is a trend that has been talked about over the last several quarters. But it's certainly something that we called out in this most recent quarter as a trend that we have heard many of these companies that not only are paying dividends, but also raising the amount that they are paying to shareholders. So it looks like, at least if these forecasts are right, we could be set up for another record year ahead.MADISON MILLS: Yeah. I remember being on with you a couple of months ago and you booking a guest who talked about the importance of getting in on dividend plays because at least, it's a guarantee of cash. And that's kind of a hedge against any of the macro concerns. It's also interesting looking at some of those big tech names that you mentioned.I'm fascinated that Meta isn't even in the top couple there because just Mark Zuckerberg alone is expected to make $700 million in dividends due to that dividend increase from Meta this year. So not a bad-- not a bad year of returns there.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly.

2024-03-14 16:00:00,4 Things Many Investors Might Not Know About Arm Holdings -- Including Certain Nvidia and Apple Ties,"Last month, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) stock rocketed 48% on the day following the chip designer's release of a strong report for its  third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on Dec. 31, 2023. Management cited artificial intelligence (AI) as a main growth driver.No doubt, the mention of AI and the stock's huge price movement brought more investor attention to the U.K.-based company, which seemed to have previously been flying under the radar of many individual investors. That's likely due in part to Arm being new to the public markets -- it held its initial public offering (IPO) last September. So even many investors who closely follow the semiconductor market are probably not nearly as familiar with Arm as they are with other big chip companies.Below are four things you might not know about Arm Holdings, whose primary business is licensing its intellectual property (IP) related to the design of central processing unit (CPU) chips.Arm was founded in 1990 as Advanced RISC Machines, which was a joint venture between the now defunct Acorn Computers, Apple, and VLSI Technology (some parts of which are now part of NXP Semiconductors).RISC stands for ""reduced instruction set computer,"" which Arm defines as a ""type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small, highly optimized set of instructions rather than the highly specialized set of instructions typically found in other architectures."" The company touts that RISC is ""often considered the most efficient CPU architecture technology available today.""Arm's energy-efficient CPU architecture is widely considered one of the key drivers of the smartphone revolution, as these mobile devices need processors that don't consume a lot of power.While Apple's first iPhone, launched in 2007, wasn't the world's first smartphone -- or cellphone that had internet access -- it played a huge part in kicking off the smartphone revolution. This phone had an Arm-based processor.Currently, more than 99% of smartphones use Arm-based processors, according to the company.Arm's board of directors includes Tony Fadell. He led the team at Apple ""that created the first 18 generations of the iPod and the first three generations of the iPhone,"" according to his profile on Arm's website. Beyond leading this group, Fadell is widely credited as inventing the iPod music player.Moreover, he is a founder and former CEO of Nest, the maker of smart-home gadgets, which Alphabet -- whose corporate name was then Google -- acquired in 2014.The answer is ""yes"" if you're wondering if at least the first and early iPods had Arm-based processors. And according to various sources detailing teardowns of Nest thermostats, they also use Arm's tech. Indeed, Arm's tech is ubiquitous in smart gadgets from TVs to watches.Fadell's background is a great fit for Arm's board, which also includes others with very relevant experience, including former executives at major semiconductor companies Nvidia, Intel, and Qualcomm. And in Qualcomm's case, it's a former CEO, Paul Jacobs.Investors who have been following Nvidia for some time probably know that the leading artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker tried to acquire Arm, but abandoned the pending deal in early 2022 after running into significant regulatory hurdles.However, it's not likely many investors are aware that Arm CEO Rene Haas spent seven years at Nvidia as vice president and general manager of its computing products business before joining Arm in 2013. Haas was elevated to Arm's CEO position in 2022 following the failed Nvidia deal.While Arm's global headquarters is in Cambridge, England, Haas is based out of the company's U.S. headquarters in Silicon Valley. This makes good sense since the bulk of the world's largest tech companies are in this region.The fact that Nvidia was interested in buying Arm makes Arm stock worth at least watching. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is as brainy and business shrewd as they come.Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

The company is still very much dependent on the iPhone for generating top-line growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, iPhone accounted for 58.3% of total sales.Services has become a major top-line contributor with the growing popularity of the App Store and the success of services like Apple TV+. In the fiscal first quarter, Services revenues grew 11.3% year over year to $23.12 billion and accounted for 19.3% of sales.Apple expects the March quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter.Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.55 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating 6.85% year-over-year growth.

2024-03-14 15:02:00,How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock,"Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday, despite falling more than 6% over the past month.Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” has urged investors to remain patient amid the recent challenges faced by the iPhone maker.Apple is reportedly venturing into AI-driven advertising within its App Store, trialing an automated product similar to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google’s Performance Max and Meta’s Advantage+.With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 sharesSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,082,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $216,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.3% to close at $173.23 on Tuesday.Also Read:  Top 5 Energy Stocks You May Want To Dump In MarchPhoto: ABCDstock/Shutterstock""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

2024-03-14 14:21:00,Has the Sun Set on Apple's Innovation-Driven Stock?,"Once one of the strongest-growing businesses of the 21st century, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) can no longer claim the title of the world's most valuable company. While second place hardly constitutes a fall from grace, investors may be wondering what the tech titan's path forward will be. In the past, Apple's annual release cycle consistently offered either new devices or significant improvements to existing products. Today, it's quite difficult to tell a 2019 Mac apart from a 2023 Mac, and even the last five iPhones have not seen any major design changes.While some product launches provided more growth than others for Apple, the general philosophy under co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and design chief Jony Ive always aimed to improve the brand's perception. During Ive's 27-year career in Apple's design department, the company went from large plastic casings to precision machine aluminum. In the five years since his departure, Macbooks and iPhones alike have gotten thicker, heavier, and larger than ever before.There are now two questions to consider before investing in Apple:Has design stagnation led to apathy among consumers who once waited in line for hours to buy its newest products?Can Apple's new foray into spatial computing help the company get back to its old self, or will it become just another contender in the space?Fiscal 2023 -- which ended Sept. 30, 2023 -- saw Apple's sales markedly decrease across many products, including Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. For each of the different devices, lower sales stemmed from unique factors. In other words, it wasn't simply a result of tightening economic conditions reducing consumer spending.For the iPhone, despite the release of the iPhone 15 models, many consumers saw very little reason to upgrade. The new phones replaced Apple's longtime Lightning connector with USB-C and added slight processing and camera improvements. The premium versions received titanium bodies. This marked the seventh year in a row in which the phone's features and form factor changed incrementally, even though the new models' prices increased.In the case of the Mac, processor upgrades did little to drive interest, and unit sales dropped by 11%. This is likely because the new Macbooks are functionally indistinguishable from the previous two years' models. Base models also still cannot support more than one monitor, which significantly limits users who need multiple screens for productivity. This has been an issue since Macbooks switched away from Intel CPUs to Apple's M-series chips.As for the iPad, 2023 marked the first year since that product's debut in which Apple did not release a new model. The result? A 15% decrease in unit sales from 2022 and insufficient marketing for the product line.Initially, Apple's business model focused on offering only the newest version of a product and discontinuing older iterations to avoid price cuts. This also meant the company could cut costs on supporting older models by decreasing the number in circulation. As of the release of the iPhone 14 series in 2022, however, Apple began offering the 13 and 12 as more affordable alternatives to the newest model. This continued in 2023 with the launch of the 15 series, with the 14 and 13 becoming the less expensive variants.Apple has also been branding even more affordable products as ""SE,"" beginning with with the iPhone SE in 2016 and followed by the Apple Watch SE four years later. With significantly more models of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, the company created its product ladder. Consumers now walk into an Apple Store expecting to buy an older model for a cheaper price but are then walked up the product ladder by seeing the incremental price and feature increases.This ultimately leads consumers to that ""Why not?"" moment, where they wonder if the $100 saved is worth having to settle for inferior features.Apple applied this strategy across most of the company's product sales and kept revenue steadily rising from 2019 to 2022 until last year's 2.8% decline.Though Apple has struggled to innovate on existing products, the launch of the new Apple Vision Pro in the first quarter of 2024 marks the company's foray into the augmented reality market. While Apple doesn't call the Vision Pro augmented reality, opting instead for ""spatial computing,"" it has a long way to go before becoming competitive in the headset market.Priced at a staggering $3,500, the headset is far out of reach for most consumers, but this is likely part of the company's ladder strategy. By introducing the Vision Pro at a high price, Apple opens up a timeline where it can release new versions, either as SE or legacy models, and slowly bring down the price over time. Whether this new product line will revolutionize personal computing and revive Apple's business growth remains to be seen.Despite revenue slipping in 2023, Apple shares rose 48% last year and nearly doubled the S&P 500's return. Unfortunately, the company's recent announcements regarding generative artificial intelligence (AI) have been greeted with a mixed reception from investors, with some expressing low confidence in the venture.Moreover, though Apple's second-largest revenue source after iPhone sales is its software services like the App Store and Apple Music, even this golden egg isn't safe. As antitrust pressure mounts regarding the App Store and its 30% royalties for app developers, the EU Commission's $2 billion fine brings the company's longtime App Store practices into question.Now might not be the best time to buy Apple shares. I'd wait until the company's new projects in augmented reality and AI mature. Yet those currently holding Apple have no pressing reason to sell the stock, even as hardware revenue slows, because software sales can help pick up the slack. I think investors should keep a watchful eye as Apple continues to transition its business model from leaning solely on hardware products to software services and beyond.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

2024-03-13 18:00:00,"'We Don't Want To Think About Apple Being Evil,' Says Y Combinator Founder Paul Graham After Tech Giant Terminates Epic Games Developer Account Over Founder's Critical Tweets","Apple Inc. is the second most valuable company in the world, approaching a $3 trillion market capitalization. Roughly 64% of Americans own an Apple product, meaning the company has massive amounts of data, and control, over the lives of hundreds of millions of people. But, the company also acts as a gatekeeper to the millions of businesses that use the Apple platform, giving it considerable control over businesses around the world.For example, Apple charges a 30% fee on nearly every transaction for digital goods on the Apple app store.  If you buy digital currency, game skins, movies or any other digital product on the Apple App Store, you are subject to this 30% fee. This has caused many of the largest names in the world to cut or amend their pricing to all because of this massive fee.Don't Miss:WealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.New homebuilding startup could be in the right place at the right time to shock real estate market – and it sells for $5 per share.In 2018, Netflix Inc. halted all new subscriptions using Apple's App Store billing as the giant wanted a 30% cut and wouldn't let new users transact outside of Apple. After regulatory pressures and lawsuits, Apple eventually allowed Netflix users to circumvent the 30% fee by directing them to the Netflix website. Netflix subscribers haven't been able to subscribe to Netflix using the App Store billing since 2018, but many remained on their pre-2018 plans, meaning Apple took their fees. Last month, Netflix announced it would be forcing some users to change their billing method away from the App Store or risk their accounts being closed.Amazon.com Inc. went through a similar issue with its Prime Video services, before cutting a deal to integrate with AppleTV to avoid the hefty fee.One of the most outspoken critics of this policy is Fortnite creator and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Sweeney, an outspoken Apple critic for years, recently sued the tech giant. The company sells billions of dollars in digital goods per year on Fortnite, meaning the company pays millions in fees for those who play the game on mobile devices. Despite attempts to circumvent the issue, Apple has maintained a strong grip on Epic and others.Trending:Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.The legal battle has continued on several fronts. The European Union recently passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to help level the playing field for people like Epic against Apple. Epic planned to launch a competitor to the App Store, which resulted in Epic Games's developer account being banned. After some challenges under the DMA from the EU, Apple reinstated the account shortly after.While this led to Sweeney touting the battle as ""victory"" on X, it led Y Combinator Co-Founder Paul Graham to comment with a larger question: Is Apple evil?Graham's post stated, ""Apple just terminated Epic’s developer account, and they admitted that this tweet was one of the reasons. We don’t want to think about Apple being evil. It would be so inconvenient. We don’t want to switch to Android. But I see ever more signs that power has corrupted them.""The post in question was from Sweeney stating:Apple leadership faces some massive decisions in the coming weeks as the contradictions between their stated principles and the intended and actual consequences of their present policies are reckoned with: the app store monopoly, the digital goods payments monopoly, the tax, the suppression of true information about competing purchasing options, the blocking of competing web browser engines and outright destruction of web apps. It doesn't have to be this way. Apple is a few bold and visionary decisions away from being the company they once were and that they still advertise themselves to be: beloved brand to consumers, partner to developers and overlord to none.""Many find it concerning that, despite the massive resources Epic Games has at its disposal Apple is still able to assert incredible control over the multibillion-dollar corporation.While corporations increasingly aren't fond of Apple, consumers love the brand.

2024-03-13 16:52:00,The Magnificent Three: Unveiling the Top Performers Among Tech Titans,"For over a decade, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, andTesla - have dominated the tech scene. But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?While I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.In this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Top DogsAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.We can see that Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.Nvidia: The Undisputed King of AINvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.This dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.Nvidia’s stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren’t looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazon: Multifaceted Technology EnterpriseAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.Meta Platforms: Always UnderestimatedDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.Under CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.Meta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.Meta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.Microsoft: On the CuspMicrosoft MSFT is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.One major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.Microsoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.Something worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag.Image Source: TradingViewApple, Alphabet and TeslaThis group is dealing with some more near-term challenges. Firstly, each of them has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating a mixed earnings revisions trend. If any of them were to experience some earnings estimates upgrades, it would go a long way in putting them higher in this list, as the Zacks rank clearly has an advantage in picking winning stocks.Apple AAPL is currently dealing with an elevated valuation, while also addressing issues of business concentration. The iPhone makes up such a large percentage of total sales, that investors have become a bit concerned about that being a risk.This seems to be getting addressed though as its services segment has been growing into a cash cow, and its venture into AR/VR with the Apple Vision Pro shows its effort to branch out into innovative new verticals.As AAPL stock rolls over some more it will become a compelling investment option.Alphabet GOOGL, while boasting one of the most advantageous and dominant businesses with search is also running into some issues. Growth has slowed considerably for the tech giant, and annual sales growth has fallen into the single digits.Additionally, management seems to be floundering as business innovation suffers and the company bloats to an unreasonable size.Alphabet is trading at a very appealing valuation though, well below its historical median of 26.2x. I think this could make GOOGL a candidate for activist investors. If Alphabet can get a bit of a shakeup, and boost earnings growth, it will again be a worthy top dog.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor me, Tesla TSLA is much more of a conundrum, and I never felt I had a strong feel for the stock. Over the last several months, Tesla stock has really cratered. This is especially concerning because is has been a banner period for the broader technology industry.Image Source: TradingViewSales growth has been stalling, and electric vehicle competition has been growing, so for me the picture is a bit more uncertain than the other stocks.Or course, those who bet against Elon Musk have not done well, and he could most certainly shift this uncertainty. Namely, the development of humanoid robots, which Musk has been teasing online for the last few months could be a world changing product.While major innovation would be fun, what Tesla really needs to see is upward trending earnings revisions. However, as can be seen below, that is not the case and analysts have unanimously downgraded forecasts.Until this can improve, Tesla is definitely at the bottom of the list.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.However, carefully consider the challenges faced by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla before making investment decisions. Remember, thorough research and understanding each company's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-13 16:10:00,How Apple can exit a slump: Analyst,"Three of the Magnificent Seven –– Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA) –– are lagging behind the other four. Apple is the second largest laggard, down 10% year to date. The company has seen four quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, weakness in Chinese markets, a hefty EU fine, and a major patent dispute. Analysts have taken note of the tech giant's challenges, with several firms downgrading the stocks or removing them from their buy lists.Needham & Co. Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Apple's performance and her optimism about a turnaround.Martin points to Apple's installed base of two billion devices: ""What they have is sort of consumer lock-in for that group of devices...Maybe demand is slower in China, but they have these really wonderfully wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem. So they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth, its a $600 billion a year business and they do $2 billion a year in it. They need to add advertising to get growth back and also advertising has 80% profit margins. They need to figure out a way to add more services and software that they can get more subscription revenue, which is a 60% margin, to get more revenue per device.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Well, three of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks are taking hits so far this year. Shares of Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla are in the red this week. And we are focusing on those three laggards and what it's going to take for some of that momentum to turn.Today, we're talking Apple. Shares are down about 10% since the start of the year. Apple came into the year with some worrisome trends. Four quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, with weakness in China weighing on those results. Apple, also facing a legal battle over the blood oxygen sensor in its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watch models. Analysts were quick to pick up on the growing problem.Piper Sandler, Barclays, and Redburn Atlantic, all downgrading the stock in the first couple of weeks of the year. Goldman Sachs, removing Apple from its conviction buy list in March. A slew of negative headlines and data has also contributed to the stock's declines this year.From the blood oxygen patent dispute to the company's disappointing Q1 results and guidance, to the reported cancelation of the company's 10-year-old EV project, and a hefty fine from the EU over Apple's App Store practices. Most recently, a Counterpoint Research report showing that China's smartphone sales dropped 24% in the first six weeks of the year compared to a year ago.So what is it going to take for Apple to turn things around? We want to bring in Laura Martin, Needham senior media and internet analyst. Laura, quite the setup for you. We have laid out what Apple has been looking at over the last several months. What is it going to take, and do you think Apple is going to turn things around?LAURA MARTIN: You know, I do. The most valuable asset they have is an installed base of two billion devices and about a billion and a half unique users worldwide, which because of their enormous price premium on their products, really it's the richest people on Earth. And that's sort of their, I'm going to call it monopoly in an oligopoly industry structure between them and Android.So what they have is sort of consumer lock-in for that group of devices. And, like you say, maybe demand is slower in China, but they have these really wonderfully wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem. So they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth. It's a $600 billion a year business, and they do $2 billion a year in it. So they need to add advertising to get growth back. And also advertising has 80% profit margins, so.And they need to figure out a way to add more services and software that they can get more subscription revenue, which is a 60% margin, to get more revenue per device. But what they have is two billion active devices, daily active devices, which is a really wonderful installed base.BRAD SMITH: And so for the management and how they're going to be able to navigate this year with pulling some of the levers that you just mentioned a moment ago, or at least leaning into some of those opportunities here.There's a lot of focus around the lighter fluid that generative AI could be to smartphone demand and the products in the future. When could that actually be realized for companies like Apple, or even on the other side of that, on an OS perspective, Android products?LAURA MARTIN: Right. So I expect Apple to continue to lag the generative AI companies. So what I think is happening in America is Google, Amazon OpenAI are creating a new basis of competition for all of American business. And Nvidia is the arms dealer in the chips for all of those. So that opportunity of gen AI is unique to a dozen companies. And those will continue to outperform Apple.Apple doesn't have the-- it operates in the smartphone ecosystem, which is a single industry. So that's what it's defending. So it can-- it's going to be limited, in my opinion, to just doing a better job in its wheelhouse, in its barn.Meanwhile, there's a maelstrom going on outside of that, that's a bigger opportunity. So I think Apple continues to outperform the S&P, but it doesn't continue to outperform these companies that are going to redefine competition in America.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-exit-slump-analyst-161001176.html,AAPL,0.114,0.036000000000000004,0.851,0.998,Positive,172.50999450683594,170.8800048828125,-0.9448667763761635,-1

It's one of the three Magnificent Seven laggards, a list that also includes Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The company hasn't been able to capitalize on AI the way other group members have and there are growing concerns about iPhone sales in China.Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre takes a closer look at Apple's charts to see what may lie ahead for the stock.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich.[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: The Magnificent Seven in focus this week as we see multiple members trading in the red. AI darling NVIDIA has logged two straight days of losses. Overall, still outperforming, though. And it's up here over the past five days by about 5%, and year-to-date, you're seeing it up as well. But three of the seven Mag Seven stocks are not outperforming. Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla all seeing losses since the start of 2024. Shares of Apple off 10%. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre over at the big board with more. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hi there. I thought this heat map here of our megacaps kind of encapsulates what we've seen this year. Apple in the red while most of the other things in the green, and Tesla down 1%. And let me show the year-to-date totals where you can see, as you just said, Apple down 10%, Tesla down 29%. Of the Mag Seven, it is the worst off. But then there's Nvidia up 80% really just outshining them all.And here's another way of looking at it. If we look at the market cap gains this year, Nvidia up almost a cool trillion dollars. It was closer to that mark a couple of days ago, but it is roaring back to it. Then you have Meta, Amazon each up more than $200 billion. Microsoft, too, thrown in that category. Then you start getting into the underperformers.Alphabet just slightly down. Tesla, although it's worse down percentagewise, only down the second worst down $224 billion. And then Apple down $327 billion. And I'll do some technical analysis on Apple chart because it is just getting back to a really interesting area. Let me put a three-month chart on. And actually, let me put a one-year chart on. And we can see what could be an M top. It's a little bit hard to see on this time frame. But as I zoom out to a three-year it'll come back in focus.And here we go, M right there. Now, if this neckline is violated, probably heading down to test a lower support area, 150 that big round number that could be one. And then below that, I got 125 to 130. And that would take it down to the place where it was exactly three years ago, so unchanged. Apple, as they say, so goes Apple, so goes the rest of the market. Not this year. Really hasn't been able to capitalize on that AI train.And you can really see this when we take a look at NVIDIA versus Apple all by itself. Here is year-to-date. Apple down 10%. NVIDIA up 80%. But over the last three years, NVIDIA just a much more high beta play. I don't know if it's fair to compare these two together, but there you go, Apple and Nvidia.And I will leave you with this because we've been talking about the race between Tesla and some of the other market cap leaders.

While Buffett has amassed a majority of his wealth through diversified businesses, his stock investments have also generated billions in passive income alone.Buffett has long advocated long-term investment strategies in established blue chip companies and has typically condoned avoiding taking immense risks.""One investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never risk permanent loss of capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been — and will be — rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a lifetime and avoid serious mistakes,"" Buffett stated in Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s annual shareholder letter.Some of Buffett's profitable investment bets have been in large-cap dividend-paying stocks.Buffett describes his stake in American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) as his ""secret sauce,"" as the company's immense dividend payouts account for a sizable portion of Berkshire's earnings.Buffett acquired his stake in American Express for $1.3 billion in 1995, but its annual earnings in 2023 ""considerably exceeded"" the cost of purchase. In addition, his total stake in American Express was valued at roughly $22 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022.Buffett's investment in American Express accounts for 4% to 5% of Berkshire Hathaway's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net worth, while the total dividend earnings from the stake amounted to nearly $302 million in fiscal 2022. The investment guru predicts American Express's dividend payouts to increase by 16% in 2024.While Buffett did not purchase or sell any shares of American Express in 2023, his ownership stake in the company rose marginally because of Berkshire's share repurchases.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

""We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.""In addition, Berkshire Hathaway's total stake in Coca-Cola was valued at $25 billion, reflecting an over 1,800% capital appreciation.Buffett claimed that Apple Inc.

2024-03-13 14:29:00,Apple will allow direct app downloads from developers in Europe,"Apple (AAPL) will begin to allow apps to be downloaded directly from developer websites in Europe, falling in line with European Union (EU) regulations.Yahoo Finance Anchors Brad Smith and Seana Smith break down the latest development for Apple and what it could mean for the company moving forward.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas JacobinoSEANA SMITH: Apple shares ticking slightly lower this morning, off just about 7/10ths of a percent after the company announced that it will allow apps to be downloaded directly from developer websites. Now this is a part of the changes that are required by new EU rules. Now this will only be available for users in the EU. But this is really, broadly speaking, a part of that overhaul that we have been talking about now for quite some time. It's going to permit third-party marketplaces to offer their own developed apps. And we bring this up because of the impact that this could potentially have on Apple's bottom line, at least in the EU here over the coming quarters, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, that's right. And they said in a blog post as well here they're going to be providing more of that flexibility for developers distributing apps in the European Union, including that new way to distribute apps directly from the developer's website, as you mentioned. They also added here that the developers are going to get access to APIs, those-- those application programming interfaces that help with the distribution of their apps from web integrate with system functionality, backup, and restore users apps, and much more, the company is saying here. So this is a significant move, really prompted by, I would say kind of two major cases that move forward. One of them, of course, being Epic Games.SEANA SMITH: Uh-hmm.BRAD SMITH: And then another one-- And what Spotify was really pushing back on with Apple. And so all of this placed even more of a spotlight on the fees that Apple gets from this, up to 30%.SEANA SMITH: Uh-hmm.BRAD SMITH: And then additionally-- 30% of the revenues, I should say. And then additionally here, the number of users data that they have access to that they eventually are able to kind of block off or, you know, institute more of their privacy mechanisms to make sure that the people who are actually developing the app are not getting as much access to that as well. Yet Apple is able to retain and advertise on top of that, even more so.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, you're exactly right there. And then also just putting this in perspective for investors out there who are looking at Apple and just saying what this could mean for the company going forward, Apple gets about a quarter of its revenue from Europe. It makes that it's the second biggest revenue driver here for the company in fiscal 2023. It makes up 42%. And its revenue come from the Americas, 25% from Europe, followed by just about 19% from Greater China.So we have talked time and time again about the issues that they are having within China, the fact that iPhone demand seems to be slumping. Uhh, at least it has been in recent quarters and then since the start of the year. So another potential issue here, uh, is important for investors to keep in mind when it comes to the European business.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/apple-allow-direct-app-downloads-142912702.html,AAPL,0.065,0.013999999999999999,0.92,0.9801,Positive,172.63499450683594,170.98500061035156,-0.9557702371977885,-1

2024-03-12 17:15:00,"Prediction: This Will Be the Most Valuable ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock by the End of 2024","If you're wondering why the stock market is back at all-time highs, there's one simple explanation: The ""Magnificent Seven.""This is the group of the seven most valuable tech stocks that include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.These stocks delivered monster returns last year, and many of them are off to strong starts in 2024, capitalizing on the AI boom and the recovery coming out of the 2022 bear market. Today, Microsoft is the most valuable Magnificent Seven stock and the most valuable company in the world. However, I think we could see a passing of the torch this year. The company that is set to take Microsoft's place? AI superstar Nvidia, which is already dominating the AI chip market and the stock market narrative.Here are a few of the reasons Nvidia is a good bet to be the most valuable company in the world by the end of the year.It's no secret that Nvidia has ridden the generative AI boom to record returns. Since the start of 2023, the stock is up by more than 500%, topping a $1 trillion market cap before passing $2 trillion earlier this year.Its revenue has tripled and its profit is growing even faster, largely because Nvidia sells the vital components to build out the AI models and applications that almost every major corporation sees is betting on. That tech infrastructure relies on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), and there's been extraordinary demand for them as analysts estimate that the company owns a 98% share of the data center GPU market.It's true that competition is on the way. AMD launched its MI300 generative AI accelerator in December, but the company's first-quarter guidance indicates that its data center revenue will still be a fraction of Nvidia's.Competition entering the market doesn't mean it will make a significant dent in Nvidia's lead as Nvidia has technological and structural advantages over its aspiring rivals. Some industry insiders have predicted as much as well.For example, Matt Wood, a vice president of artificial intelligence products at AmazonWeb Services told The Information, ""There's no meaningful competition"" for Nvidia, and he was skeptical that AMD or anyone else could pose a significant challenge to the AI chip leader.If Nvidia can successfully defend its market share against AMD, Intel, and others, the stock should move even higher.Skeptics believe that Nvidia and other AI stocks are in a bubble, and its bumper profit is temporarily inflated by supply constraints for AI chips. Once that supply crunch is solved, they argue, prices will come down and Nvidia's profit will fall.However, there's no sign that supply imbalance will resolve itself anytime soon.Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the recent earnings call, ""We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply,"" and CEO Jensen Huang elaborated, noting that supply is improving, but added, ""We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply.""Huang made another point that's key to understanding the supply demand dynamic in AI chips, saying, ""With all of the new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products.""While competition may fill in supply for less powerful components, demand for cutting-edge technology is likely to continue to be difficult to meet, and that's where Nvidia excels. It should remain the leader in the product category, GPUs, which it invented 25 years ago and has advanced ever since.While Nvidia's near-term success will be determined by its data center business, investors shouldn't forget that the company has the ability to move into new markets such as PC chips, which it announced in January, and it's well positioned to capitalize on evolving markets such as autonomous vehicles and the metaverse.Nvidia's technology has a long history of finding new applications, including digital gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and now AI, but it's a mistake to think that it won't penetrate and dominate new markets as it's done with AI.The PC chip market presents an attractive opportunity for Nvidia, with tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue available, and Nvidia could turn the tables on AMD and Intel there, taking market share from them in PCs rather than ceding it in AI.Nvidia has soared past Wall Street's expectations in each of its past four quarters, showing that analysts continue to underestimate the company's growth and demand for its AI components.Currently, the average analyst expects Nvidia to generate earnings per share of $24.50, but that number is likely to go up, assuming the company's current momentum continues.At that valuation, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 40, making it not much more expensive than Apple or Microsoft, the two companies it's chasing to gain the title of the top Magnificent Seven stock. Microsoft trades at a P/E ratio of 35, based on estimates for its fiscal year that ends in June, and Apple trades at a forward P/E of 26.At a market cap of $2.32 trillion, Nvidia's stock price would have to increase 31% to eclipse Microsoft's current level of $3.04 trillion. That kind of gain looks to be within reach for Nvidia, given its dominance of AI chips and the ongoing supply crunch that should support its wide profit margin.It's no accident that Nvidia stock has skyrocketed in the AI boom. It holds the key to unlocking the power of generative AI, and that seems unlikely to change. As demand grows for AI and the components that make it work, Nvidia should go even higher.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The point with Alphabet is that it is expected to grow sales and earnings at considerably higher paces than the S&P 500, while its shares trade at a lower valuation than that of the index as a whole.Nvidia has a relatively high P/E of 34.1, but that valuation has come down considerably over the past year. Nvidia tops this list of 25 of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 whose EPS estimates have risen more quickly than the share prices.Related: Nvidia’s stock could hit $1,200, this bull says. Here’s the key to that rally.Getting back to Alphabet, the stock is down 5% from where it was at the end of 2021. It is useful to look at performance from that date, because the S&P 500 fell 18.2% in 2022, only to rise 26.3% in 2023. (All returns in this article include reinvested dividends.)So the S&P 500 is up only 3.4% since the end of 2021, while Alphabet is down 5% and Nividia’s stock has tripled in price.On Monday, Michael Nathanson, a senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a note to clients that Alphabet’s stock had been ”de-rated” relative to the S&P 500, reflecting investors’ concern over artificial intelligence and its possible effect on Google’s search business.He also pointed to a recent misstep, when Google botched the rollout of its Gemini AI tool for generating images.“Ironically, Alphabet’s long-term reluctance to ship AI products that were not yet safe, reliable, and responsible did not compute with what just happened here,” Nathanson wrote.The analyst also cited a ceding of advertising market share to Meta and Amazon “for much of the past decade.”But then he pointed to Meta, another company that had disappointed investors: CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s initial vision of the metaverse didn’t work out very well, and it was followed by a “year of efficiency” for the company in 2023, which helped reverse its share-price slide.Nathanson rates Alphabet’s Class A shares a buy, with a $175 price target, which is 29% higher than the stock’s closing price of $135.41 on Friday.Summing up, the analyst wrote that “the basic question is about Alphabet’s ability to harness their deep pool of world-class engineers and their long-term embrace [of] machine learning to build products thatconsumers want to use.”He concluded: “Judging by past accomplishments, despite current headlines, that seems like a bet that investors should be willing to make akin to buying Meta in the 4th quarter of 2022.”Here’s a summary of ratings and price targets for the Magnificent Seven among analysts polled by FactSet:CompanyTickerShare buy ratingsShare neutral ratingsShare sell ratingsMarch 8 priceConsensus price targetImplied 12-month upside potentialMicrosoft Corp.MSFT95%5%0%$406.22$469.9716%Apple Inc.AAPL58%30%12%$170.73$199.8617%Nvidia Corp.NVDA92%8%0%$875.28$897.213%Amazon.com Inc.AMZN95%5%0%$175.35$208.2219%Alphabet Inc.

2024-03-12 16:06:00,How Tesla can leverage R&D to stay in the Magnificent 7,"Shares of Tesla (TSLA) have fallen over 27% year to date, with fellow Magnificent Seven companies Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) also lagging behind the rest of the group. Are these companies doomed to fall from the pack or does the dip represent an opportunity to buy?Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors.Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: ""First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up. Third is continuation in growth. Really good growth in their energy storage business.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino- Tesla is a Magnificent 7's biggest laggard year to date, but it's not the only one. Shares of Apple and Alphabet are also in the red since the start of the year. Now this week, we are focusing on these three laggards and what it's going to take for the companies to turn things around.Today, the focus is Tesla, currently trading just around 179 bucks a share, a loss of nearly 30% this year alone. Our next guest, though, saying that now could be a good buying opportunity. For more on that and what the catalyst will be, we want to bring in George Gianarikas.He's with Canaccord Genuity as a managing director there. George, it's great to see you. So talk to us about why you think Tesla is a buy at these levels?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Well, first, let's address the reason why it's lagged. I mean, it's pretty simple. The numbers have come down. I mean, if you look at the earnings revisions for the last 12 plus months, they've been terrible.I mean, I think we started for 2023 somewhere early in that year on $6, and it came all the way down to $3. And I think we're at a period of time right now where the worries likely exceed the reality. And we had some numbers last week come out of China that weren't very good.But people didn't take into account that the new year has been pushed into February. Also, some stuff that happened. In Germany, their plant came down for about a week because of arson, a week plus. And in the US, people are worried about the production of their new Model 3.And we think that the best way to kind of gauge for the most part of what's happening with Tesla, particularly in the US, is to look at their prices. And they've been pretty stable in the US over the last couple few months. So there's a lot of wood to chop still in the quarter. But in the near term, we think that we may have overcorrected here to the downside.- They talked on their most recent earnings call, George, about the spending and some of the record R&D that they had done during 2023, which now places a lot of emphasis on bringing that to fruition in 2024 and years following now. How much of that spending do you anticipate will lean further towards the side of this artificial intelligence narrative that has started to prevail with Tesla, even though we've seen some early slippage this year, at least, in the price action?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Look, we're in a little bit of a pause period right now for the stock. And the near term wiggles, we think we've overcorrected. But for the stock to really get its legs, we have to have three things happen. First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful.Second, their margins need to go up. And the most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI that they've built, in addition to volumes starting to pick back up. And third, it's continuation in growth, really good growth in their energy storage business.So when you talk about leveraging this R&D that they've spent a lot on, it's two real products that come out of that, the big spending. It's number one, that next generation vehicle, which we think should start production in the second half of 2025 and continued FSD penetration.Now we think that the FSD offering from the company at $12,000 currently is a little too rich, particularly relative to the cost of the vehicle. We think the company should cut the price of that FSD to really increase penetration and really have the margins start to turn in. If you think about it, that offering is about 100% gross margin very, very high gross margin because it's a software upgrade.- George, we have seen, though, the price wars play out, obviously, Tesla far from the only automaker, one of many, I should say, that has been forced to lower the prices, obviously, putting pressure on margins, very similar to what you were just saying. How do you see that more broadly speaking beyond Tesla shaking out just a bit? And that pressure to the downside in terms of boosting demand, how much longer are they going to be forced to prices in order to drive the demand that we simply have not seen?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Well, look, there's been a pause, like I said, recently. Particularly, in the US, the price declines that we saw for the most part in 2023 is sort of ebbed right now, which for us, is indication that maybe things aren't that bad. And what the company did strategically by being that aggressive is, first of all, they got to sell more vehicles.Right? Because interest rates went up, and most people finance the purchase of their vehicles. So that meant that the prices of vehicles went up artificially. But second, it put a lot of their competitors on their back legs.I mean, margins got a lot worse for some of the pure play EV competitors. Sales got a lot worse for them. And even for the traditional OEMs that try to compete against Tesla, their margins got significantly worse because they couldn't compete with Tesla on price. So what we saw is-- longer term what Tesla did is put a lot of its competition on the back foot, particularly in the United States and Europe.- And so, let's talk then about China because that's one of the larger kind of lingering risks right now for Tesla. Is sentiment shifting so much in the region that there would be a longer term implication for how Tesla is able to operate and sell into China, as well?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: That's a great question. I mean, look, we see the real competition for Tesla long term, like, we really like Rivian in the United States, and in parts of Europe, and other parts of North America. But in China, specifically, there are some very, very good OEM competitors from pure play EV companies.The company has one plant in China right now, able to produce about 950,000 vehicles. And they're running-- despite this monthly volatility, they're running full tilt there. And we'll continue-- we continue to believe they'll run full tilt in that country. So there's really good competition in China, but we think Tesla can operate that factory at relatively full capacity that leaves them in a good place in that country.- So, George, as we wrap this up, we started this segment talking about the share price being under pressure. We're trading around 179 bucks a share today. What more specifically does that upside look like?GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Look, our price target is in the 230s, and we base that on 26 times our 2026 estimates. And we think that's going to happen as volumes start to pick up next year and the year after that based on increased Cybertruck production and the next generation vehicle.And importantly, we think that the margins will start to get better, particularly as we've seen an abatement and price reductions, at least, for now and costs continue to come down for the company. So, in the near term, we have these wiggles. And we think like we said, we've overcorrected to the downside in the near term.But for real outperformance, we need to-- next generation vehicle or some visibility into that increased margins based on FSD mostly and continued growth in their energy storage business. Those three things will really get the stock to get its outperformance legs of old back.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/tesla-leverage-r-d-stay-160625612.html,AAPL,0.114,0.054000000000000006,0.8320000000000001,0.9985,Positive,173.08999633789062,172.4250030517578,-0.3841893235901818,0
2024-03-12 15:37:00,Apple’s hysterics over the new EU antitrust law have led to two climbdowns already—and the law hasn’t even been in force for a week,"European Commission 2–Apple 0.The EU’s Digital Markets Act has been in place for less than five days, and its enforcers have already pushed Apple into two humiliating U-turns. If Apple has been trying to test how much it can throw its weight around in its increasingly hilarious hissy fit over the new Big Tech antitrust law, it’s had its answer now.The first reversal came earlier this month when Apple meekly agreed to let home-screen web apps continue functioning as intended on iPhones. It had previously killed off the entire category on the basis of protecting users’ security under a rather odd reading of the DMA. The Commission threatened an investigation, and Apple retreated.Then, on Friday, Apple agreed to reinstate a developer account for archnemesis Epic Games, effectively allowing it to roll out a third-party iOS app store (an actual DMA demand) and also finally return Fortnite to iOS devices in the EU.Apple’s reason for axing Epic’s account was that Epic had previously violated Apple’s policy by launching an alternative to Apple’s payment system for in-app payments (which is why Apple banned Fortnite from the App Store in 2020). Apple had also argued that Epic’s criticism of Apple’s new EU business model meant it couldn’t be trusted to follow the terms for third-party app stores, even though Epic had promised to abide by them. Apple’s reasoning was doubly ludicrous because a) the Commission wants affected companies to give feedback on Big Tech’s attempts to comply with the DMA, and b) Apple claimed a California court ruling gave it the ability to cancel Epic’s developer accounts anytime it wanted, anywhere in the world.After the Commission again threatened an investigation—and presumably after Apple’s lawyers googled “jurisdiction”—the company again backed down. “I take note with satisfaction that following our contacts Apple decided to backtrack its decision on Epic exclusion,” cackled Commission digital chief Thierry Breton in an X post. “From Day 2, [the] DMA is already showing very concrete results!”I think at this point it’s fair to say that Tim Cook’s team has been massively overreaching in its response to the DMA. But hey, nobody ever said compliance with EU tech law was easy.You know who else just learned that lesson? The European Commission.This morning, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)—the privacy regulator that specifically keeps an eye on big EU institutions—slammed the Commission for breaking a 2018 data-protection law in how its staff use Microsoft 365. The watchdog said the Commission had failed to implement safeguards to ensure that people’s personal data is only being sent to countries whose data-protection rules are equivalent to the EU’s. What’s more, the Commission hadn’t been properly specifying what types of personal data would be collected in the use of Microsoft 365, and what the data would be used for, as the law demands. (This isn’t the well-known General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, but rather a special companion law that only applies to the EU institutions.)As a result, the Commission will have to “suspend all data flows resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 to Microsoft and to its affiliates and sub-processors located in countries outside the [EU and European Economic Area]” that lack adequate privacy protections. It’s unclear which countries the watchdog means. The EDPS has given the Commission until early December to comply, reflecting how difficult it will be to comply with the decision without majorly disrupting the Commission’s work.The Commission insists that its use of Microsoft 365 is legally compliant; it’s studying the EDPS order before deciding how to respond. But, it said in a statement, “compliance with the EDPS decision unfortunately seems likely to undermine the current high level of mobile and integrated IT services. This applies not only to Microsoft but potentially also to other commercial IT services.”Fairly or not, I suspect quite a few Silicon Valley regulatory officers will be chuckling at the irony of the situation.

2024-03-12 15:13:00,Magnificent 7 laggards: Tesla stock slides considerably in 2024,"Five of the Magnificent Seven tech stock components saw stock declines in last week's trading. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre eyes several of the group's biggest laggards, highlighting EV maker Tesla's (TSLA) year-to-date losses.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: Five of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks suffered declines last week with Tesla faring the worst, off about 13.5%. And despite the Mag Seven accounting for around 50% of S&P 500 gains this year, three of its members are lagging behind. Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet are all in the red year to date.And once again, you see Tesla leading losses. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre, he's over at the big board with more. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Such as it is, sometimes we group these stocks together arbitrarily. They might be doing something similar for a limited period of time and then they get stuck. And here we have the Magnificent Seven with huge dispersion between the contributions-- among the contributions to the S&P 500 market cap.You look at NVIDIA over there, it's up $965 billion. And then you take a look at Tesla down $231 billion. As NVIDIA's contributing 33% of the market cap gains of the S&P 500, Tesla is responsible for negative 8%.And sometimes math is just not intuitive that way. But the point is besides these four groups of stocks that are advancing, you have these other three. And to be fair, all seven of these stocks have very, very different narratives.I want to point out Tesla versus NVIDIA. So this is the first in class, this is last in class in the Mag Seven. And this what's happening year to date. You can see Tesla down about 27%, NVIDIA up about 78%.And if I show you a two-year chart, you can really see back when their fortunes diverged. Because it was off of the October lows in 2022 that we saw this big rally and we saw the Mag Seven, kind of, in lockstep. But you can see the fortunes diverging as we proceeded in the year, that was last year.Now, I also want to show some technical analysis on Tesla over the last five years. And what I'm seeing here is just a giant trading range with a couple of forays above and below. And so here we got above the trading range here. We got below around the turn of the year one year ago.But for the most part, we are in a trading range. Until that breaks, difficult to see or difficult to get excited about Tesla going in any direction or the other. It looks like it got a little bit of time.So I do want to go to our Mag 100-- or NASDAQ 100 heat maps so I can just check out the totals here. It's been interesting. I've been watching Eli Lilly surge ahead of Tesla in terms of market cap. And here we see Tesla at $571 billion short of AVGO, that's Broadcom. That change was made last week. And now Visa, looks like Tesla heading for Visa's market cap next.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/magnificent-7-laggards-tesla-stock-151336705.html,AAPL,0.069,0.039,0.892,0.9472,Positive,172.58990478515625,172.63999938964844,0.029025222856775067,0
2024-03-12 15:02:00,TD taps into iPhones for a leg up in merchant acquiring,"Years after companies like Square convinced micro-merchants that they could accept payments with their smartphones, banks are starting to make the same pitch — without the need for an add-on ""dongle"" or similar hardware.TD Bank, for example, last week added Tap to Pay on iPhone to a growing bundle of products that it sells to businesses. Tap to Pay, also called softPOS, enables Apple or Android handsets to accept payments from contactless cards or mobile wallets. More payment companies are using Tap to Pay to enable fast and cheap contactless payment upgrades. PayPal adopted Tap to Pay last week to enhance the products it offers to merchants. Financial institutions can also use it to reduce merchants' reliance on third parties.""Small businesses are inundated with a number of applications to manage cash flow and back offices,"" said Jo Jagadish, executive vice president and head of commercial banking products, services and innovation at TD Bank, where she leads the bank's business payment strategy. ""Payments is just one of those capabilities that merchants use, but it can drive usage for other products.""The bank noted a massive consumer shift towards contactless payments that started during the pandemic, creating ongoing demand for merchants to adopt contactless payment, according to Jagadish. Tap to Pay enables businesses of all sizes to access mobile commerce and banking, but is particularly useful in reaching smaller merchants, she said.Tap to Pay is an Apple technology, but Apple is not a payment processor, creating an opportunity for other companies to sell the technology to banks or merchants. TD Bank added Tap to Pay through its collaboration with Autobooks. TD Bank is an investor in Autobooks, an accounting and bookkeeping provider, which it uses to support digital invoices, debit and credit card payments, cash flow management and accounting as part of the TD small business checking account.TD Bank has added other merchant services accessible via the checking account over the past few years, including Zelle and digital invoicing. All of these functions involve the mobile phone, making Tap to Pay a good fit, Jagadish said.""The majority of our customers use Apple devices,"" Jagadish said.TD Bank is upgrading its business banking operation as it faces challenges in other areas that involve technology. The bank is upgrading anti money-laundering systems amid a regulatory probe of AML practices at the bank and is also in the midst of an institution-wide cost cutting initiative. The bank's public relations office said the Tap to Pay deployment and related merchant services products are not part of the AML issues.Autobooks clients include Citizens Bank, Zions Bank and hundreds of small community banks. It has licensed its technology to FIS, Jack Henry, NCR and other firms that sell payments and financial technology. About 50 banks are live with Tap to Pay contactless payments via Autobooks.Another user, Centier Bank, has also used Tap to Pay as a bridge to a larger merchant product bundle. Centier, a $7.5 billion-asset bank that operates mostly in Northwest Indiana, offers accounting, checking and digital invoicing, among other merchant services. ""By using Tap to Pay, a business can support payments, sending and receiving through their bank account with us rather than worrying about a third party. We think that's an advantage for us,"" said Tim Coleman, senior vice president and director of wealth management and small business at Centier Bank.Tap to Pay enables the bank to support digital payments for all merchants, regardless of size, according to Coleman. The bank's clients include about 20,000 businesses, ranging from ""side hustles"" to larger manufacturing businesses, with a diverse mix of other merchants. ""It's an intersection of businesses. You never know where the demand is going to come from,"" said Coleman.TD Bank and Centier — and thousands of other financial institutions — are battling JPMorgan Chase, the largest merchant acquiring bank in the U.S. JPMorgan recently upgraded its merchant acquiring business by launching a platform that integrates payment channels alongside a set of tools that support checkout and other functions in stores, online and in mobile apps. JPMorgan added support for Tap to Pay for iPhone in 2023, and plans to add biometric check-in and additional contactless payment features in future deployments.All three banks compete with merchant-focused fintechs like Stripe, PayPal and Block, all of which have adopted softPOS or Tap to Pay. Adyen, a Dutch payment technology company, is using Tap to Pay to bolster its point of sale technology in brick and mortar in tandem with its e-commerce technology.Banks can integrate new products into existing services as a way to compete with larger institutions to attract merchants, including smaller businesses, according to Mattew Golden, president of Totavi, a card consulting practice.""The proliferation of standardized payment platforms such as Square, Stripe, Shopify and Toast means that fewer businesses are proactively making decisions about their underlying merchant acquirer; instead they are choosing a platform and then that platform is choosing an acquirer,"" Golden said, adding that to respond to this trend, institutions can connect businesses to newer payment technology using application programming interfaces or similar connecting technology — thus reducing the need for extensive integration.""As always, another area where smaller institutions can succeed is in service and support,"" Golden said.

2024-03-08 20:58:00,"Hey, Bottom Fishers! 3 Beaten Up Stocks to Buy for Short-Term Gains","One tool that bargain hunters can utilize to identify beaten up stocks to buy after significant declines is the relative strength index (RSI). The RSI signals when a stock’s downward momentum may be exhausted, indicating that a correction could provide upside potential.Typically, an RSI reading below 30 is viewed as an ‘oversold’ level, suggesting the asset may be due to a rebound. However, the RSI alone is insufficient to conclude a buying opportunity exists in beaten up stocks to buy. A thorough review of the company’s financial position is prudent to evaluate whether value currently exists.The following three stocks have seen their share prices decline substantially recently.

Due to its undervaluation and strong fundamentals, ACI could be considered one of the beaten up stocks to buy.Albertsons trades at a relatively low valuation, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 8.7x – less than half the broader U.S. grocery sector at 17.2x. This leaves the stock undervalued, representing one of the more compelling beaten up stocks to buy for patient investors.​Source: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.comMedifast (NYSE:MED) has been facing some headwinds lately. The weight loss and supplement company suffered from consumers’ ability to hire weight loss coaches and the arrival of Ozempic and other drugs. The most recent earnings missed expectations, weighing heavily on the price of this beaten up stock to buy. Management remains hopeful of a turnaround following a deal with LifeMD (NASDAQ:LFMD) to expand sales channels.The company’s shares dropped significantly, with its RSI reaching an oversold level of just 5.9. What’s interesting for potential investors is that Medifast trades at a P/E ratio of only 4.2x despite the earnings miss. The forward dividend yield stands at 17.4%, and the company increased its cash holdings. This indicates that the dividend is well covered and provides attractive value for investors in this beaten-up stock.Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comEven major technology firms are not immune to market volatility, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders are now well aware. The iPhone maker experienced a difficult beginning in 2024 as sales in China and across the EU fell short of expectations. Apple’s stock price has dropped 12% this year, placing the company – a long-term favorite of Warren Buffett – in its most oversold position in six years at an RSI of just 22.1.While a business as large and well-established as Apple may not immediately spring to mind when considering beaten up stocks to buy, technical analysts note the current weakness presents investors with a potential buying opportunity to secure a high-quality business at a temporarily discounted valuation. Only time will tell if 2024 brings an uptick in fortunes for the technology titan. However, long-term backers will hope current headwinds prove a mere blip rather than the start of a longer-term downtrend.​Apple’s P/E ratio trades at just 26.3x, below the S&P 500‘s 27.7x. Investors may see the beaten up stock to buy as a good quality choice that will shine through in the longer run.On the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-08 20:28:00,Do These 2 Stocks Belong in the Magnificent 7?,"The so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ group, consisting of Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Tesla TSLA, NVIDIA NVDA, and Amazon AMZN, has been a dominant story within the market for some time, performing remarkably and providing stellar gains.They’ve led the market, with recent quarterly results from a few members adding further excitement and extending the positive price action.However, two of the members in particular, Apple AAPL and Tesla TSLA, have come under scrutiny amid considerable underperformance relative to the rest of the group. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven their underperformance, should they be kicked out of the elite club? Let’s take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.Apple Apple hasn’t seen any positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, with analysts lowering their expectations across multiple timeframes. The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcerning headline figures in its latest release, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, climbing 2% year-over-year. Quarterly EPS totaled $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago mark and reflecting a record. In addition, Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and jumped 11.3% from the same period last year.Apple’s Services portfolio has been an excellent source of growth, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone. Nonetheless, shares fell following the report, attributed to demand worries in China. Sales in the region reached $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year as the company faces competition in the area.Slowing growth has undoubtedly been reflected by the recent share performance, with consensus expectations for its current year suggesting 7% earnings growth on a marginal 0.6% sales increase. Still, shares are currently trading at their most oversold levels in years, undoubtedly worth keeping an eye on.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven the company’s remarkable cash-generating abilities, established customer base, and news surrounding AI, the company’s long-term view remains bright. If positive earnings estimate revisions begin creeping in, shares will likely follow and move higher. TeslaOnce hailed as the poster child for growth stocks, Tesla’s share performance over the last year has left many investors with a sour taste. Lower margins, hybrid momentum, and competition in China have all been thorns in the side of the company.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s gross margin on a trailing twelve-month basis.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe weak share performance has coincided with bearishness among analysts, with the company’s earnings outlook moving lower across all timeframes. The stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, the company continues to be the dominant EV player, with the Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle in the world throughout 2023. And operations remain sound – Tesla posted $4.4 billion of free cash flow throughout its FY23 and saw its cost of goods sold per vehicle decline sequentially throughout its Q4.The company’s growth is forecasted to stall slightly in its current year (FY24), with consensus estimates alluding to 1.3% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. Growth resumes in a big way for FY25, as expectations presently suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 20% higher revenues.The stock remains a prime consideration for those bullish on the long-term EV picture, but analysts’ recent revisions reflect a cloudy near-term outlook.Bottom Line The ‘Magnificent 7’ has been on the minds of all investors, whose performance as a group has been remarkable.Still, two members of the club – Tesla TSLA and Apple AAPL – are beginning to be shunned by the market, with the share performance of each over the last year lagging considerably.Both Tesla and Apple remain great long-term stocks, underpinned by fundamentals and operational execution. But recent performance has been anything but magnificent, especially when compared to the other members.It’s worth noting that many of the other Mag 7 members, including Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft MSFT, currently boast a much stronger earnings outlook. All four of these members presently sport a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), reflecting upward-trending earnings estimate revisions.The remaining member, Alphabet GOOGL, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but has seen positive revisions across multiple timeframes as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-08 19:37:00,EU looking into Apple's decision to kill Epic Games' developer account,"The European Union has confirmed it's looking into Apple's decision to close Epic Games' developer account -- citing three separate regulations that may apply.Yesterday the Fortnite maker revealed Apple had terminated the account, apparently reversing a decision to approve the developer account last month.Epic had planned to launch its own app store, the Epic Games Stores, on iOS in Europe, as well as Fortnight on Apple's platform. And it accused Apple of breaching the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA) by killing its developer account.Responding to the development, a European Commission spokesperson told TechCrunch it has ""requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.""The pan-EU regulation applies on Apple from midnight Brussels' time today.The spokesperson also said the EU is evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise compliance ""doubts"" with regard to two other regulations -- the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the platform-to-business regulation (P2B) -- given what they described as ""the links between the developer program membership and the App Store as designated VLOP"" (very large online platform).Rules the EU's DMA applies to Apple, as a designated ""gatekeeper"" and its App Store, as a so-called core platform service, require the company to permit third-party app stores. Failure to comply with the DMA risks major penalties -- of up to 10% of global annual turnover (or 20% for repeat offenders).While a subset of rules in the DSA, which also apply to Apple's App Store as a designated VLOP, have been in force for larger platforms since August 2023 -- with the rest of the regulation's provisions applying on platforms and many more digital services since last month. Penalties for breaches of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover.The EU's P2B regulation, meanwhile, contains measures intended to boost platform transparency and curb unfair practices. It has been in force for longer (since 2020).Under the P2B law, sudden and unexpected account suspensions are banned, with platforms having to provide clear reasons for terminations. However, unlike the DMA and the DSA's regime for VLOPs, P2B enforcement is not the responsibility of the Commission. It's devolved to member state level authorities, which also determine any possible penalties for breaches. Although it's possible Commission enforcers may factor in whether platforms play nice with P2B rules as part of their assessment of VLOPs' DSA compliance, given there is some overlap in scope.Epic has claimed Apple terminated its developer account in retaliation for its criticism of the iPhone maker's DMA proposal, which requires developers to sign up to new T&Cs that include a new ""core technology"" in order to tap into DMA entitlements.Yesterday, Apple issued an aggressive statement in response -- hitting back at Epic's accusations and citing a U.S. court ruling as justification for terminating its account. It also claimed no executive had reviewed Epic's application to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, suggesting it was done via a click-through agreement.""Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right,"" Apple wrote yesterday, citing a September 2021 U.S. court ruling pertaining to Epic’s litigation against Apple. The game maker sued Apple in the U.S., alleging it was abusing its market power by forcing companies to use its own payment systems.In September 2021, the U.S. court ruled Apple does not hold a monopoly in digital mobile gaming transactions. Although it did order it not to prohibit developers from adding links to their apps to direct users to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the purchase of digital goods.At the time, Apple trumpeted the judgment as a win -- saying the court had found the App Store does not violate antitrust law. The U.S. court also did not require Apple to allow third-party app stores or sideloading. However, under the EU's DMA, Apple is required to permit third-party app stores and third-party software downloads and must not block business users from offering wares through their own channels.The U.S. court ruling Apple is citing to justify terminating Epic's developer account is unlikely to have standing in the EU. However, Apple may be seeking to play one legal jurisdiction off against another -- which has decided its market power is a problem and already passed laws regulating how it can operate its App Store.Apple was contacted for a response to the Commission's request for further explanations of its actions under the DMA and to the doubts the bloc is raising about its compliance with other measures applied to the App Store by the DSA and P2B. It said it has nothing further to add to the remarks it made yesterday -- which argue the U.S. court ruling affirms its contractual right to terminate Epic's account.In those remarks, Apple noted the termination of Epic's account is not limited to the EU. It said its Developer Program License Agreements (DPLA) are global agreements; claimed Epic's breach of the DPLA agreement (via its ""hotfix"" patch, which sought to circumvent Apple's rules by covertly deploying code that let users purchase in-game currency) was also implemented around the world, including in Europe; and suggested the court injunction allowing termination is globally applicable.The company also noted Epic continues to litigate against it in the U.S. and Australia.Update: The EU's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, has also now weighed in on the spat -- writing on X: ""Under the DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers. I have asked our services to look into Apple's termination of Epic's developer account as a matter of priority."" He urged developers to get in touch with their feedback on gatekeepers' compliance.🚨Under the #DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers.I have asked our services to look into Apple’s termination of Epic’s developer account as a matter of priority.To all developers in 🇪🇺 & 🌍: now is the time to have your say on gatekeepers’…— Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) March 7, 2024Europe’s DMA rules for Big Tech explainedApple terminates Epic Games developer account calling it a ‘threat’ to the iOS ecosystemThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/apple-epic-dev-account-dma/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/eu-looking-apples-decision-kill-102512197.html,AAPL,0.039,0.046,0.915,-0.8909999999999999,Negative,170.22000122070312,173.5399932861328,1.9504124319239466,1
2024-03-08 19:34:00,"Down, But Not Out: 7 Stocks With Massive Comeback Potential","Some of the top stocks are down right now, but don’t write them off just yet. Instead, use the pullbacks as an opportunity to jump into stocks with comeback potential.The reasons for the declines are many and include weak guidance for the year ahead, problems in overseas markets such as China, and declining spending on the part of consumers. While notable, these issues are by no means insurmountable and it is unlikely that many of the leading companies will see their share prices stay down for long.As such, investors would be smart to pounce on the stocks while the share price is still in the red. After all, the goal remains to buy low and sell high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMany companies whose stocks are down currently recognize the problems they’re experiencing and are taking proactive steps to fix the issues, with some companies announcing ambitious, multi-year growth strategies. Again, use the pullbacks as an opportunity to jump into stocks with comeback potential.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is having a tough time right now. Year-to-date, the consumer electronics giant’s share price is down 8%. That compares to a 7% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index so far in 2024.The company’s share price is declining on growing concerns about sales of its signature devices. Mostly the iPhone. And mostly in China. AAPL stock just got rocked by a report from Counterpoint Research that showed Apple’s iPhone sales in China declined 24% during the first six weeks of the year.While the Chinese market, and iPhone sales, are areas of concern, there are still plenty of reasons to be bullish on the company and its stock. The services side of Apple’s business (streaming, banking and apps) are more than making up for declines in sales of the company’s hardware. Apple’s earnings continue to beat Wall Street estimates. And the company has just launched a brand new electronic device with its Vision Pro mixed reality headset. And Apple is now turning its attention to artificial intelligence (AI).Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another leading technology company whose stock is down this year. Since the start of January, GOOGL fell about 4%.Unfortunately, its value dropped 8% in the last month after Alphabet launched a defective AI image generator that drew much scorn on social media. The AI image launch was so bad that even Google co-founder Sergey Brin publicly criticized it, saying that the company “definitely messed up.”The poorly received image generator has heightened concerns that Alphabet is falling behind in the AI race, sending its stock lower.However, investors would be foolish to count out Alphabet. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just put out a note urging clients to stick with GOOGL stock. JPMorgan says that Alphabet will get its AI program back on track and any backlash against the company will be short lived. JPMorgan adds that Alphabet has the resources and talent to close the AI gap with its rivals.Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comIt’s an extremely tough time to be a shareholder of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Since the start of the year, TSLA stock has plummeted 27%. The company’s stock has been the sixth worst performer in the S&P 500 index so far this year. The drop comes amid rising concerns about demand for electric vehicles. While the entire EV market is experiencing a downturn, the impact has been especially damaging at Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicle sales.Like Apple, Tesla is having a particularly difficult time in China, where an economic slowdown has led consumers to put off motor vehicle purchases, particularly pricey electric vehicles. TSLA stock recently fell 7% in a single day on news that the company’s EV sales in China have fallen to their lowest level in more than a year. While Tesla certainly faces what look to be long-term challenges, its important to remember that the stock has been here before — several times.Between November 2021 and January 2023, TSLA stock fell 72% only to come roaring back. Company CEO Elon Musk retains a devoted following among retail investors.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comShares of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) were clobbered after the company’s recent earnings print. The cybersecurity firm’s share price fell nearly 30%, for its worst one-day performance ever, after management lowered their full-year guidance for both revenue and billings.The downbeat guidance completely overshadowed the fact that Palo Alto Networks beat Wall Street forecasts with its latest financial results, reporting earnings of $1.46 a share on revenue of $1.98 billion.Senior executives at the company did their best to explain that the lowered guidance was due to a shift in strategy and wanting to accelerate growth in artificial intelligence (AI) products. Unfortunately, nobody seemed to listen beyond the news that the company lowered its guidance for the year ahead.In time, this will all be smoothed out and Palo Alto’s AI strategy will be made clear. There are already signs of a recovery, with PANW stock having moved 11% higher from its post-earnings bottom.Source: monticello / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has restarted talks with the union that is organizing workers at its U.S. stores and says it is willing to negotiate labor agreements. This approach can only help SBUX stock, which is down 13% over the past 12 months and near a 52-week low.Up until now, Starbucks had fought unionization drives at its stores that began in 2021, and the issue has harmed the company’s reputation and share price. Starbucks has also been hurt by a boycott in the U.S. and increased discounting by rivals in overseas markets, notably China.However, there is reason for optimism with SBUX. Not only is Starbucks taking a proactive approach to labor relations, but the company has also unveiled details of a strategic plan that will see the retail coffee chain open 17,000 new locations by 2030 even as it cuts $3 billion in costs. Management at Starbucks is being assertive on all fronts.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) also has a strategy to help it grow in coming years. In December, the quick service restaurant chain announced a plan to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. Those targets are part of the company’s plans to grow its worldwide sales and boost its stock price, which is down 2% year to date after trading sideways over the past 12 months.McDonald’s has also announced plans to attract and retain customers with revamped versions of its burgers and chicken nuggets. For this year, McDonald’s is projecting net new restaurant growth of 4%. After next year, the company plans to grow its restaurant count by 5% annually. By 2027, the company wants to have 50,000 restaurant locations globally. To reach that goal, McDonald’s plans to open 900 new locations in America, 1,900 restaurants internationally, and 7,000 units in developing markets.The company is also testing a new spin-off brand called “CosMc’s” that is aimed at teens and twentysomethings. The growth strategy is a big reason to believe in a comeback for MCD stock.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comShares of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) hit the skids. The athletic apparel company, known for its yoga pants and workout clothes, saw its share price fall 12% so far in 2024. The selloff comes after the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the final quarter of last year, which included the year-end holiday shopping period. However, there is reason to believe that LULU stock can get up off the mat and rise again.First, the company has since revised up its fourth quarter 2023 sales and profit forecasts on strong sales during the holidays. Lululemon next reports earnings on March 26. Second, Lululemon is expanding into a new market segment with the launch of men’s sneakers. The company says it wants to gain market share in the male sportswear segment after dominating in the women’s market. The men’s footwear includes two running shoes and a casual sneaker that hit stores on Feb. 13 of this year.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

2024-03-08 19:26:00,Europe's DMA rules for Big Tech explained,"The Digital Markets Act (DMA), an ex ante European Union reform of digital competition rules, will be in force today, by midnight Brussels' time, on six tech giants -- applying a new set of legal requirements on more than 20 of their ""core platform services"" (CPS).Online empires that scaled in an era of minimal interventions from regulators, shaping the commercial web as we know it, are now facing a prescriptive set of rules on how they can operate and do business in the EU, including hard limits on their use of data; interoperability mandates; and bans on self-preferencing.The six companies designated under the DMA so far -- as so-called Internet ""gatekeepers"" -- are: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft.Read on for an overview of the new law, its early impacts on platforms and Big Tech, and how it might change digital business as we know it, starting in Europe...The aim of the pan-EU regulation is -- essentially -- to crack open Big Tech's market power. The DMA shoots to make digital markets fairer and more contestable by applying a set of up-front obligations and restrictions on the kingpin players entrenched atop digital markets. Such as -- for example -- a ban on Google's self-preferencing in search results; or on Amazon using rivals' data to feed its own retail product development; or on Meta processing user data for ad targeting without people's consent; or a ban on Apple banning third party app stores from its mobile platform, iOS.Data portability and interoperability are key planks of the regime -- which also, for example, requires Meta to open up its WhatsApp and Messenger platforms to rival services to allow cross-platform access. Idea being smaller messaging apps can offer their users the ability to reach people using those dominant messaging networks without having to sign up for an account with their gatekeeper.EU lawmakers generally want the DMA to foster service switching and ""multihoming"" to reduce Big Tech's grip on web users' eyeballs and wallets, unlocking the chance for competitors to get a look in. Put another way, the phenomenon of online services evolving into self-reinforcing ecosystems and empires, through network effects and gatekeeper lock-in tactics, is the centrifugal force the DMA is attacking with a range of pro-competition countermeasures targeted at strategic gateways, like app stores, operating systems and web browsers.Whether the regulation will actually succeed in loosening dominant platform operators' grip on digital markets is uncertain. But the EU is going to try.The main DMA criteria for a platform being deemed an ""important gateway"" for business users to reach end users, and whose entrenched owner/operator has a ""significant impact"" on the EU's internal market, is annual revenue of at least €7.5 billion in each of the last three financial years or a market cap of at least €75 billion in the last financial year. A gatekeeper must also provide the same CPS in at least three EU Member States; and these platforms must have at least 45 million monthly active users regionally and at least 10,000 business users.The bloc has given itself some wiggle room to designate ""emerging"" gatekeepers, too -- if the Commission believes a platform will gain an entrenched and durable market position in the near future it can also impose some rules, with the aim of preventing that outcome.The DMA's sizeable ambition is backed up with serious teeth, too: The regulation allows for penalties of up to 10% of global annual turnover for breaches -- or even 20% for repeat offences. So we're talking fines that could run to tens of billions of dollars apiece.Oversight and enforcement responsibility is centralized with the European Commission. This is an attempt to streamline enforcement and avoid the patchy outcomes we've seen with other EU digital regulations, thanks to variable resourcing and forum shopping. However this approach piles complex and high stakes work on the EU's executive -- so one question is whether the bloc might have bitten off more than it can chew?The DMA does allow for private enforcement, too, in the form of litigation targeting non-compliance -- so gatekeepers could face being sued in European courts over unfair practices if they fail to get with the program.Currently, the six gatekeepers' regulated CPS span a number of techno playing fields -- namely: Social networks (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn); “intermediation” services (Google Maps, Google Play, Google Shopping, Amazon Marketplace, iOS App Store, Meta Marketplace); ads delivery systems (Google, Amazon and Meta); browsers (Chrome, Safari); operating systems (Google Android, iOS, Windows PC OS); N-IICS or Number-Independent Interpersonal Communication Services (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger); search engines (Google); and video sharing platforms (YouTube).The regulation allows for CPS to be designated in other tech arenas too, such as cloud computing services and virtual assistants. But so far none have been named in those domains -- and cloud computing is one notable early gap (especially given the role hyperscalers like Microsoft are playing in the fast developing generative AI market).Asked about the cloud computing designation gap, the Commission told us the DMA is built on a system of self-assessment which requires platforms to notify it when they consider they meet the regulation's thresholds -- which no cloud operator has so far done.""At this stage we do not have elements to question this self-assessment,"" the Commission spokesperson said, adding they will ""continue to monitor market developments"" in cloud -- and also emphasizing the current tally of six gatekeepers (and 22 CPS) is ""only the start, not the end"". More gatekeepers and/or CPS may well be added to the list soon. Reports earlier this month said social media firm X, TikTok's parent ByteDance's ads business and European online travel agency Booking.com have notified the Commission of reaching the regulation's usage thresholds -- suggesting they could progress to being designated in the coming months. (The Commission told us it has 45 working days to take a decision on this trio of potential designations.)It's worth noting a number of gatekeepers are also challenging their designations in the bloc's courts. (Three so far: Apple, Meta and TikTok.) So it's at least possible some platforms could convince judges they don't qualify as entrenched gatekeepers and be struck off the list. (ByteDance, for instance, is arguing it should be seen as a Big Tech challenger, given its relative newness on the scene vs longer in the tooth tech giants. But it remains to be seen what EU courts will make of the argument.)Some tech giants have also deployed counterarguments that have been successful at avoiding designations. For example, the Commission recently decided against adding Apple's iMessage, Microsoft Advertising, its search engine Bing and web browser Edge to the list -- after accepting arguments their respective services are not popular enough to qualify.Last year the Commission also decided against designating Samsung's internet browser, despite the company notifying the EU it hit DMA usage thresholds -- with the bloc assessing it did not hold the necessary gateway position in the browser category. The EU also chose not to designate webmail providers, Gmail and Outlook, at that time, accepting counterarguments against their intermediating market power too.The bloc's intention has always been for the DMA to be tightly focused -- on only the most powerful gatekeeping giants. However one early (political) charge levelled at the EU's approach is it puts restrictions and obligations on (only) foreign (and mostly U.S.) tech giants.This attack tactic is one that seems particularly weak and unlikely to trouble Brussels. If digital market power is concentrated offshore then a regulation that aims to rebalance tipped digital markets must, necessarily, shoot at offshore targets. And it's fair to say U.S. lawmakers have themselves raised plenty of concerns about homegrown platforms' market power in recent years.In any case, European platforms that build enough momentum to fall into scope face becoming regulated, too -- as Booking.com may soon be.In recent weeks we've seen a range of moves by gatekeepers in claimed preparation for compliance with the DMA. Apple's new ""core tech fee"" on iOS and opening up to non-WebKit-based browsers in the EU, for instance, or Google tweaking how it displays some search results and quietly switching off default cross-service tracking of its own users.Meta has also given a glimpse of work to roll out messaging interoperability to WhatsApp and Messenger. That particular strand of the regulation will take time to bear fruit as in-scope messaging platforms get three months to respond to interoperability requests. So how effective and user-friendly these implementations will be remains to be seen.The regulation also allows for a phased rollout of messaging interoperability, with only basic functionalities (texting, image/video and file sharing and asynchronous voice messages between two individual users) required initially. Group messaging interoperability isn't required until two years after a gatekeeper designation; while a full four years has been allowed for platforms to put in place interoperability for video and voice calling, between individual users and groups.At the same time, Meta looks to be attempting a direct swerve of other DMA requirements, aimed at reforming privacy-hostile business models, by concocting a version of consent that requires users to pay literal money if they want to avoid being tracked and profiled.So, in short, the early picture is mixed, with so many pieces in flux and uncertainty over how exactly the law will be enforced. It'll likely take time before we see how much market transformation the DMA is actually driving.While some early moves by tech giants look significant and could create interesting new opportunities for competition and innovation, others are obviously cynical and self-serving -- showing entrenched platform giants doing their level best to avoid having to end exploitative practices and/or reform entire business models.Days out from the DMA compliance deadline we're also seeing some editing of compliance proposals in response to early criticism. Such as Apple removing certain requirements it had said it would impose on developers wanting to take up entitlements, after they complained it was making it too arduous for them to tap into the new opportunities.Bear in mind, whatever gatekeepers' blog posts and briefings claim on DMA compliance, it'll be up to Commission to assess whether or not they're meeting the legal bar. So we're not going to get a clear picture of how digital markets will actually change until we start to see how and where the EU will take enforcement action to rein in gatekeeper flexes and tackle competitive pinch-points.This also means there's likely to be ongoing PR war, involving both the gatekeepers themselves and their fiercest critics, as each side seeks to shape the narrative about what's real or fake compliance. (See, for instance, Spotify's immediate decrying of Apple's reworked iOS fee structure and Apple's aggressive pushback by putting a spotlight on the scale of Spotify's app business success. Or Epic Games claiming yesterday that Apple terminated its iOS developer account after it criticized its DMA proposal as ""malicious compliance"". So get the popcorn in.)The Commission is actively calling for stakeholders to send feedback on DMA compliance moves to support its assessment of gatekeepers. Effective oversight will clearly require an industry-wide effort. To this end, it's organized a series of workshops in Brussels later this month when it wants tech giants to sit around a table and discuss compliance, face to face, with business users.How -- or even whether -- gatekeepers engage in good faith with this EU process will be fascinating to watch. Although they must make their compliance reports public. But if platforms refuse to turn up in person to defend their compliance approaches they'll be leaving their loudest critics to bend EU enforcers' ears unchallenged. This means gatekeepers are facing a bit of a Hobson's choice that, for once, is not of their own dark pattern design.The workshop set-up looks cleverly conceived by the Commission as a tactic to compel gatekeepers into dialogue (and potentially concessions) about compliance shortcomings. Whoever best engages with the EU may have the strongest chance of cementing compliance narratives that sway DMA enforcers.At the same time, tech giants remain exceptionally well resourced, employing armies of lawyers who will have been tasked with poring over the detail of the DMA to find weak spots and loopholes they can exploit to minimize damage to commercial self-interest. Legal challenges to enforcement decisions look highly likely. Which means the Commission will have to divert resources into defensive action, too, and there's a risk of the regime getting bogged down in litigation as time goes on.Judging by early compliance proposals, some gatekeepers appear to have calculated they'd rather take their chances in the courts -- and risk hefty DMA non-compliance fines -- than willingly dismantle lucrative business-as-usual on Day 1 of this New Online World Order. So far, for example, both Apple and Google have indicated they plan to keep charging fees even if app developers selling digital goods on their mobile platforms make use of DMA-enabled opportunities to point their users to cheaper offers outside the gatekeepers' stores to complete transactions. Bottom line: Rent demands won't stop tomorrow. So expect the likes of Spotify and Epic Games to keep crying foul.Since the DMA does not ban gatekeepers from charging fees for their services, nor stipulate a set formula for rates -- beyond requirements to have T&Cs that are FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) -- platform giants may feel confident they have a strong case that the fees they charge are fair and reasonable given how much technology and market access their platforms provide.However, in recent days, the Commission has signalled it may be preparing to take action over complaints about unfair fees. Speaking earlier this week, as she hit Apple with an almost $2 billion fine over anti-steering on the music streaming market, the EU's competition chief and EVP for digital matters, Margrethe Vestager, said “novel fee structures” should not be used as a tactic to undermine incentives for developers to do something else.In another example of early DMA friction, look to Meta's bid to force consent from EU users via imposing a 'pay or be tracked' choice on users of Facebook and Instagram, both now designated CPS. The adtech giant's apparent refusal to reform its business model, even with the DMA coming into view, follows years of complaints over its unlawful processing of user data under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Two other legal bases Meta had claimed for the ads processing were overturned last year -- forcing a switch to consent. But instead of giving users a free choice to deny tracking, Meta concocted a controversial ad-free subscription choice that puts Facebook and Instagram users in a privacy bind.It will therefore be very interesting to see what the Commission does about this -- now DMA gatekeeper's -- attempt to redefine EU law around consent to fit its commercial self interest. ""Gatekeepers should not design, organise or operate their online interfaces in a way that deceives, manipulates or otherwise materially distorts or impairs the ability of end users to freely give consent,"" runs the regulation's recitals vis-a-vis ""personalized advertising"". The law also stipulates: ""Not giving consent should not be more difficult than giving consent.""Earlier this month, the bloc sent Meta a request for information about its ad-free subscription under the DMA's sister regulation, the Digital Services Act (DSA) -- which also puts limits on the use of people's data for ads (and came into force on Meta's business last August). So the EU is already scrutinizing Meta's consent model. How they act on such an obvious privacy abuse with the DMA also in force will be one to watch.Elsewhere, gatekeepers appear to be accepting some of the operational writing on the wall. In recent days, for example, a number of the tech giants have been announcing data portability APIs. We've also had notice of incoming choice screens -- from Apple and Google -- which EU lawmakers hope will open up competition in web browser and search markets.While the devil will be in the detail of how these screens are designed, and when and where they pop up, some early responses are sounding positive.Eco search engine, Ecosia, has described Google as a ""collaborative partner"" during the design process for the incoming search choice screen, for example. ""There is now a unique opportunity for alternative search engines such as Ecosia -- with less than 0.1% of the global market share (compared to Google’s 92%) -- to take full advantage of these improved market conditions and openness,"" Sophie Dembinski, its head of public policy and climate action, noted in a statement this week.On the flip side, privacy search engine and browser, DuckDuckGo, got in touch to tell us it's radically unimpressed by Google's initial offer.""By deciding to only show a choice screen when people are setting up an Android device for the first time, Google is artificially limiting how many people are even exposed to a choice screen -- for Android, that is a 3% to 5% of the total user base per quarter, bringing in frustratingly slow change to the market,"" it wrote in a briefing note circulated to press this week. ""The process is broken. Gatekeepers shouldn’t be in a position to propose solutions to problems they created. Third party experts should be involved in the compliance process from the get-go, with rapid iterations on implementation to reach mutually agreed KPIs.""DuckDuckGo argues the DMA demands far more meaningful reform on default choices -- saying Google must make it persistently easy for consumers to switch default choices, rather than just popping up occasional choice screens. So this is another fight where the Commission will have to not so much pick a side as choose where the compliance line lies.Also on the negative side, mobile developers are decrying what they dub Apple's ""scare screens"" -- aka, notifications the iOS maker intends to pop up to warn users of the risks of transacting outside its App Store. But the DMA does allow gatekeepers to take ""necessary and proportionate"" measures to safeguard user security. So the Commission may even be dragged into refereeing the substance and tone of these sort of user-facing comms.How the Commission handles its new role as gatekeeper enforcer remains to be seen. But one wider effect the DMA looks to be having is inspiring lawmakers elsewhere to pass similar laws so users in other countries can tap into opportunities that can be seen unfolding in the EU as the bloc has a go at taming Big Tech.The so-called ""Brussels' effect"" leading to DMA copycats is already being discussed. ""We're seeing copycats around the world already,"" said Bill Echikson, senior fellow at the Washington-based thinktank the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), which counts a number of gatekeepers among its members, speaking during a press briefing this week. ""We're seeing copies of this Digital Markets Act or variations of it appear in places like Japan, the U.K., Brazil, Mexico, even India... So, I think, in the democratic world, it will become the de facto standard.""""A decade ago, you would have said the tech companies were sort of like teenagers and they really didn't face much regulation. And now they're grown ups and they are going to be regulated -- a little bit like banks, telecoms and other industries that have a tremendous impact on our lives and on the economy,"" he added.The short answer is it depends. Even if gatekeepers do everything that's demanded by their fiercest critics and crack open the gates of their ecosystems to unleash new and exciting opportunities for competitors, it will still require end users to take a sustained interest in alternative apps and services.If there's no uptake, and users prefer to stick with branded wares from familiar tech giants, the DMA's high profile goal of unlocking competition and innovation will fall flat. The Commission itself is well aware of this risk.""What the DMA is really about is to ensure fairness and contestability -- provide for choice and opportunities -- but it's also important that those choices and opportunities are taken up and exercised. Otherwise we may not see changes in every area where we would want to see them because very often it will depend on take up,"" warned Denis Sparas, deputy head of unit at DG CNECT, in the European Commission, during a DMA-focused panel discussion earlier this week organized by the European Digital SME Alliance.""I think there is a ground to be optimistic,"" he added. ""What we see are quite significant improvements, compared to what we have initially seen as the proposed compliance solutions -- and these improvements will result in tangible changes. Having said that, many of these changes also depend on the fact that choices and opportunities which will be provided are also taken up.""Take Google: The tech giant routinely defends itself against charges that it's unfairly self-preferencing its own products at the expense of rivals by claiming its apps are popular simply because they provide users with the best utility. Unsurprisingly, then, it has sought to frame the DMA as anti-user -- suggesting the law will reduce convenience for web users who, it implies, are most likely to find changes it enforces annoying.Apple also maintains that its mobile ecosystem offers users the strongest privacy and security -- similarly arguing, therefore, that the EU regulation is anti-user as it's essentially forcing it to degrade the quality of products it can provide to Europeans.Expect these sorts of arguments to persist. And there is a clear risk of gatekeepers deploying changes in a way that's designed to generate more unwelcome friction for users in a bid to -- both -- undermine support for the regulation and work against the intended competition-boosting effect by making it difficult for people to use alternatives.Add to that, there will be more pop-ups arriving on the back of this EU law -- whether giving users a choice to obtain more privacy by denying platforms' ability to link their data across accounts; letting them pick from a choice of browsers or search engines to set as their default; or warning they're headed 'off world' and transacting elsewhere means they're no longer under the platform's own customer support and refund rules. These notifications will be an obvious target for the law's critics. And may well annoy a bunch of users.It's also quite possible that a lot of web users are happy with what Big Tech provides them. And simply aren't interested in alternatives. But the DMA does at least offer a way to test platform controllers' arguments that they're only popular because they're the best -- and see whether, on a more level playing field, there is appetite for more variety in digital services.A few extra pop-ups seem like a worthwhile trade-off for the chance to reconfigure some of the self-serving incentives that have shaped the commercial web for decades. And even, potentially, reform entirely exploitative business models.One cautionary note here: Years of EU antitrust enforcement on Google has failed to dent its regional market dominance and fire up rival tech like search engines, despite the imposition of interventions like choice screens. However that earlier competition action was undertaken under classic antitrust laws, where enforcement is slow and reactive. Whereas the aim for the DMA is to flip the odds by setting rules up front that outlaw a bunch of unfair lock-in tactics.The bloc hopes this ex ante approach will finally be able to deliver a genuine competition reboot. One aspect hasn't change though: It's still up to gatekeepers to design their own compliance -- so attempts to game the rules or just implement the narrowest possible solutions are a given.That said, given it's already so late to reset Big Tech's market power, the EU is facing huge pressure to act quickly to tackle the most egregious DMA abuses. The Commission is starting on the back foot, facing -- per its own assessment -- a set of entrenched gatekeepers. This should concentrate minds in Brussels on the need to move fast and make DMA enforcement count. But with so much the EU could arbitrate here it's also likely Commission enforcers will pick their battles. So where DMA enforcement falls first will be really interesting to watch -- as it will set the tone for the bloc's approach.Gatekeepers that have opted for a defiant and even aggressive stance (hi Apple!) could just be putting themselves first in the firing line. Gatekeepers whose business models are already subject to charges of systematic non-compliance with EU law (hey Meta!) should also be worried. And while Google may generally play a slicker PR game, it has a very high level of exposure to the DMA on account of how many of its platforms are designated. The EU has also signalled a willingness to contemplate structural remedies in Google's case, warning last year, when it issued a statement of objections for suspected anti-competitive conduct of its adtech business, that the only viable remedy, if a breach of the law ends up being confirmed, is to split Google up.While we'll have to wait and see how exactly DMA enforcement will play out, one thing is clear: There is plenty of appetite in Europe for a crackdown on Big Tech, both among small businesses and web users.""There are some gatekeepers that put certain proposals that are really designed purely in bad faith,"" said Jurgita Misevičiutė, public policy lead at the privacy-focused app maker Proton, during the same panel discussion on the DMA this week. ""We really call on the European Commission... to be really bold and to take swift and strong action against such gatekeepers, because developers, the industry, they don't have another 5 to 10 years to wait until compliance happens.""Asked where it thinks DMA enforcement should fall first, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) told us it wants the Commission to apply ""urgent scrutiny"" on Meta and Apple. “We have real concerns that on D-Day of the Digital Markets Act, some gatekeepers will not comply with the rules they have known about for years now,"" said Agustin Reyna, its director for legal and economic affairs. ""It is really important that the Commission sends a clear signal that this is serious and unacceptable.""Some cases require urgent scrutiny. For example, Meta’s data practices, from what we have seen so far, might violate the DMA, while Apple’s announcements about how they plan to comply with the DMA are clearly insufficient. The Commission has to open infringement proceedings if non-compliant gatekeepers do not adapt their practices immediately.""As noted above, the Commission is under considerable pressure to ensure a flagship digital reform delivers results. So there is absolutely a sense of urgency in Brussels.During Tuesday's SME Alliance panel discussion, DG CNECT's Sparas responded to concerns the Commission may not move quick enough to tackle Big Tech by emphasizing that its thinking on enforcement does not involves timeframes that run to years -- rather he suggested it's going to be a matter of ""days, weeks and months"".The letter of the law states market investigations to consider system non-compliance can take up to 12 months, with up to six months allowed for the Commission to deliver preliminary conclusions. But interim measures may allow for swifter action -- where the Commission determines there is ""urgency due to the risk of serious and irreparable damage for business users or end users of gatekeepers"", as the regulation puts it.Also speaking during the SME Alliance panel discussion, Johnny Ryan, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties' senior fellow and director of its Enforce division which focuses on enforcing humans rights on technology, urged the Commission to unbox these interim measures powers stat to tackle long-standing Big Tech abuses.""There is a clear line to how you impose interim measures if you go through the GDPR -- which of course the Commission can under the DMA,"" he suggested. ""I would urge the Commission to be moving as fast as possible... to mark an investigation of systematic non compliance under Article 18(1).""If the EU hits the ground running -- applying interim measures and opening investigations of systematic non-compliance -- it would ""signal with action, not words, that it is fully prepared to take serious measures, including structural remedies"", Ryan added.During the panel, Sparas said the Commission won't always use ""the most far reaching measures"" -- suggesting the EU is hoping the regulation, as a whole, works to reform gatekeepers' behavior simply on merit of having heavily cranked up their regulatory risk.The DMA does allow gatekeepers to offer -- and the Commission to accept -- commitments to address concerns on an ongoing basis, i.e. rather than waiting for formal enforcement. So the EU will want to keep up pressure on platforms to proactively address complaints, such as via the forthcoming public workshops.EU enforcers also have powers to request information and conduction on-site inspections. The bloc can also always raise the temperature by getting commissioners to issue public warnings about issues of concern, as we've seen happening in recent weeks, too, as compliance proposals have emerged.It may be hoping gatekeepers opt to tweak ops in contested areas to avoid the risk of formal DMA proceedings, given the potential for hefty sanctions at the end. And, again in recent days -- so still ahead of the DMA actually applying -- we've seen some instances of editing to compliance proposals in the face of pushback, such as Apple tweaking some of the requirements on developers to take up entitlements. The Commission has also emphasized that proposals have improved vs the first iterations gatekeepers came with last year. So some platform reforms may happen quickly.However, as DMA Compliance Day has loomed, gatekeepers have largely been entrenching on their most heavily criticized positions -- such as Apple and Google's app store fees or Meta's 'consent or pay' model. This suggests the biggest -- potentially most transformative -- reforms of Big Tech business models aren't likely to happen unless the Commission takes formal enforcement. So the baton passes back to the bloc to drive real change.Where non-compliance is ""very blatant"" Sparas emphasized the EU ""will need to act very quickly"".""One thing that we have learned, for good or bad, is that if we want to really make a change here it is very important that we act quickly,"" he said, adding: ""Of course still in a legally sound way. But [we need] to act quickly and effectively. Because otherwise, as we said at the time of the [DMA] proposal, many of these markets are prone to very quick tipping. So... if we take too much time, things may change to a point where it's very difficult to change things back.""This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/europes-dma-rules-for-big-tech-explained/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/europes-dma-rules-big-tech-140528903.html,AAPL,0.105,0.066,0.828,0.9996,Positive,170.06500244140625,173.38009643554688,1.9493099382883312,1
2024-03-08 19:19:00,3 Standout Tech Stocks to Buy Down at Least 15%,"Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores where the stock market stands in the early days of March and why there hardly appears to be a tech bubble forming. The episode then digs into why investors might want to buy three tech stocks trading at least 15% below their all-time highs—Adobe, Apple, and Block.The bulls dug their heels in at the Nasdaq’s 21-day moving average midweek and the buying continued through morning trading Thursday. The rhythm of the march to start 2024 has prevented stocks from severely overheating, as the market experiences mini pullbacks every few weeks.The tech bubble talk and AI exuberance clouded that some tech stocks have taken a beating recently while others are yet to recover from their 2022 downturns. Investors might want to be greedy while others are fearful and buy impressive tech stocks at a discount while Nvidia and others reach overbought levels in the short-term.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe trades roughly 20% below its all-time highs heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on March 14. Wall Street is worried about its slowing top-line growth and how it will compete as companies such as OpenAI enable users to generate creative content with almost no skills. Investors are also disappointed that Adobe had to scrap its planned Figma acquisition over regulatory headwinds.ADBE’s revenue expansion cooled over the last two years following a stretch of 15% to 25% expansion. Still, the creative software giant posted 10% and 12% sales growth the last two years and Adobe’s revenue is projected to climb 10% in FY24 and 12% higher in FY25 to reach $23.91 billion. ADBE’s adjusted EPS are projected to jump by 11% and 13%, respectively and its positive revisions help it land Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobe’s industry-leading creative software is still used by Hollywood movie studios, best-selling artists, college students, companies, and more. Adobe is also rolling out AI features across its portfolio.ADBE has slipped -2% in the last six months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s +20% run. ADBE is down 15% since early February and 20% from its 2021 highs. ADBE trades below its 200-day moving average and near oversold RSI levels. But it remains above its long-term 50-week moving average. On the value side, Adobe trades 60% below its 10-year highs and at a 7% discount to its median at 36.4X forward earnings.Apple (AAPL) Apple stock has fallen 12% YTD vs. Tech’s 9% climb and Nvidia’s (NVDA) 85% surge to trade 15% below its mid-December records. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth in China and increased geopolitical conflict in the world’s second-largest economy. Investors also fear Apple is falling behind on AI.Fears about slowing expansion in China are valid. On the other hand, it will no doubt be able to introduce AI features at some point soon. AAPL sales declined 2.8% in FY23 revenue (its third YoY decline during the last eight years). Apple is projected to post 1% growth in FY24 and 5% higher sales in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 7% and 9%, respectively.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCEO Tim Cook has transformed Apple beyond an iPhone maker. The firm’s active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, with well over 1 billion paid subscriptions (double four years ago). AAPL’s services efforts include the App Store, Netflix and Spotify competitors, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, and more. On top of that, its Vision Pro devices are catching on at the enterprise level.Apple closed last quarter with $65 billion in net cash and plans to keep buying back stock and paying dividends as it attempts to become net cash neutral. Apple stock climbed by roughly 800% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 290% run. Yet, Apple is only up 45% in the past three years and it has underperformed tech in the last 12 months, up 11% vs. 48%.Apple trades below its 50-week moving average, which is a level it has rarely stayed below for too long over the last decade. AAPL is also trading at oversold RSI levels. Valuation-wise, Apple trades at a 25% discount to its 10-year highs at 24.9X forward 12-month earnings vs. Tech’s 26.2X.Block Inc. (SQ)Block, formally known as Square, trades over 70% below its peaks. SQ moved sideways over the last 12 months vs. Tech’s 48% and trades at early 2020 levels before its Covid bust and massive boom. Wall Street dumped the former tech star because of rising interest rates, slowing consumer spending, tough-to-compete against periods, increased competition, and an ill-timed acquisition.  Block appeared to greatly overpay for buy now pay later firm Afterpay at the height of tech valuations. Block is also a victim of its overnight Covid-induced boom. Its sales soared 86% in 2021 and 102% in 2020, climbing from $4.7 billion in FY19 to $17.66 billion in 2021 vs. its pre-Covid pace of around 40%.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBlock remains a futuristic digital banking and financial services firm for consumers and businesses. Block posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 after its sales were roughly flat in 2022. The firm is projected to post 13% revenue expansion in FY24 and 12% higher in 2025. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 64% this year and 31% next year.Block’s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and 29 of the 40 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” next to only one “Strong Sell.” SQ is back above its 50-day moving average. The stock’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term growth outlook, is at 2.2 vs. Tech’s 1.9 and its one-year highs of over 200. Block trades at a 60% discount to Tech at 1.9X forward 12-month sales and 84% below its highs.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2024-03-08 19:15:00,Apple M3 MacBook Air review: Still the best Mac for most,"Before we go any further, a question: What makes a computer an AI computer? Is it simply the ability to execute AI-powered tasks? To run LLMs locally? Is it something deeper? Is any computer that is capable of running any form of artificial intelligence/machine learning fundamentally an AI computer?It’s a simple question on the face of it. But the truth is, we’ll probably never have a satisfying answer. Still, it’s important to calibrate as we head deeper into the year of ""AI everything.""If you’ve been playing along at home, you weren’t too surprised when Apple humbly crowned the new M3 MacBook Air as the “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI” in a recent press release. The qualifications “laptop” and “consumer” are primarily meant to distinguish the new notebooks from other Apple products, which one assumes are the best AI desktop and laptop, respectively.It's not so much that there’s anything inherent to this update that makes the new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air an AI powerhouse, per Apple's description. Rather, it’s the implication that the building blocks have been there the whole time -- specifically in the form of the Neural Engine. This element has been a fixture of Mac silicon for years but often gets overshadowed by the CPU and GPU, which are generally easier for both consumers and reviewers to wrap their brains around.The feature is harder to quantify in terms of real-world performance versus, say, a graphics chip but is perhaps best understood as something along the lines of a GPU targeting machine learning. It's been clear for some time that this will be an increasingly essential aspect of day-to-day computing, a fact that the arrival of ChatGPT and its ilk has brought into sharp focus for many consumers.Image Credits: Brian HeaterApple is leaning so heavily into the concept for the same reason Samsung positioned the S24 as the industry’s first “AI phone” and why Google referred to the Pixel 8 Pro as “the first smartphone with AI built in” last year: zeitgeist. These are marketing concepts to a large extent, but they're a good barometer for where the industry's collective head is at.The sudden explosion of generative AI has transformed artificial intelligence from abstract and theoretical to concrete and tangible for many. Naturally, everyone wants a piece of it. You can expect Apple to lean into the notion even more heavily when the iPhone 16 launches later this year. After all, machine learning has been an important aspect of features like computational photography for some time.As of right now, however, Apple can’t tell exactly the story it wants to tell. The company's generative AI narrative is -- at the moment -- one of delayed gratification. During Apple’s most recent quarterly earnings call, Tim Cook promised “groundbreaking innovation” in the generative AI field, adding, “We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.”Image Credits: Brian HeaterApple is no doubt investing boatloads into the category, even funneling members of its ill-fated automotive team into the space. Given the head start currently enjoyed by the competition, however, hardware is something Apple can point to in the here and now. Some of this also likely stems from the fact that the new Airs aren’t fundamentally new pieces of hardware. Rather, they’re refreshes with new(ish) silicon.That’s to be expected. The Mac line has seen a LOT of change over the past four years. All of that work came together in a brilliant way with last year’s Air models. I don’t hesitate to call them the best consumer laptop Apple has ever made. Depending on where your operating system allegiances lie, it’s not a stretch to call them the best laptops for most people, full stop. They’re not perfect -- sacrificing certain “Pro” features for the sake of weight and size has been a longtime feature of the line -- but many or most of them are things the average consumer won’t realize are missing.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe 2023 Air benefited greatly from Apple’s work on first-party silicon through the M line of chips, coupled with learning from past stumbles like faulty keyboards and the largely DOA Touch Bar. The end product felt like precisely the MacBook so many of us wanted for so long: lightweight and powerful, with great battery life and a reasonable (in Mac terms) price point, starting at $1,099 for the 13- and $1,299 for the 15-inch. If anything, the line has cemented the Pro as a niche product by comparison, as the Air has replaced the standard MacBook as the model for most.As a professional writer, I consider myself to be in a fairly creative field. I record and edit podcasts every week, along with the occasional video. I get to test all sorts of laptops for this gig, and I keep coming back to the Air. Certainly my frequent work travel plays a considerable role in the tech I choose, along with some newfound degenerative back problems.For my money, the 15-inch model gracefully balances the line between screen size and portability. At 3.3 pounds, it never felt like a burden carrying on my back all last week at Mobile World Congress and (don’t tell the Delta flight attendant), it sits comfortably in the seatback pocket.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThere are really only two things that make me miss the Pro at all. The first is the port problem. Both Air models have a pair of USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports next to the MagSafe connector. There are times when things get bunched up over there, making me miss the 16-inch Pro’s three ports. That in itself isn’t enough to get me to switch. Nor, for that matter, are the times I miss having an SD slot. Dongles are a pain, but they’re very much part of the modern condition in Apple land. If I was constantly shooting with an SLR, however, I would likely be telling a different story.Now, the port math changes considerably depending on your home/office setup. I’m lucky (or, perhaps, foolish) enough to have a desktop system at home. Much like the Pro models, this is probably overkill for many or most, especially when factoring in (1) cost and (2) the fact that the M3 chip has support for two external monitors.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe iPad may have eaten into Mac's market share among more casual users, but as the laptop line has gotten more powerful, it's supplanted the need for a devoted desktop for many. There's great versatility in a device you can travel the world with, take home and dock into a pair of external monitors. In the case of the Studio Display, the process is as simple as connecting to the Thunderbolt port and closing the laptop hood. Not much configuration is needed beyond that, and suddenly you've got a ton of screen real estate and an array of freed up ports on the backs of the monitors.Given the power and performance of even the standard M3, there really is not a compelling reason not to. This is one of the great paradoxes of Apple silicon: The more powerful it becomes at the base, the more niche the high-end devices become for most users.The only real caveat to all of this is gaming. Apple would never have admitted it, but the $300 billion-odd industry has been an afterthought for most of the Mac’s life. In spite of an early advantage, Apple was lapped and ultimately left behind by the industry. For decades, gaming on the Mac seemed like a lost cause. If you wanted to play anything much more complicated than solitaire, you bought a Windows machine or console. This isn’t to say that Apple’s caught up by any meaningful metric (the gaming library still can't hold a candle to Windows), but a combination of first-party silicon, Metal and development for the iPhone has, at the very least, put the company back in the conversation for those who want to move beyond mobile.If gaming is your number one raison d'être, a Mac probably isn’t on your list. If, however, AAA gaming is a slice of your overall computer needs, you can reasonably have that itch scratched. It’s true that the macOS library still pales in comparison to Windows, but Apple has begun remedying that with some day and date releases from big-name studios.Image Credits: AppleThe M3 arrived last year as part of Apple’s “Scary Fast” (it was the day before Halloween, mind) event. The company bucked its standard silicon release cadence by introducing three versions at once: the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max. One gets the sense that ramping up production, coupled with the ongoing supply chain issues of the past four years, has done a number on the release road map.A refreshed 24-inch iMac was the recipient of the base M3, while new MacBook Pros got the M3, Pro and Max. The base M3 features an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU (upgradable to 10-core) and 16-core neural engine. Both the 13- and 15-inch models have 8GB of RAM by default, configurable up to 24GB. Likewise, the 256GB of storage goes up to 2TB.Image Credits: Brian HeaterIn fact, beyond display size (technically 13.6- and 15.3-inch, respectively) and starting price, there’s not much in the way of distinction between the two machines. This much was clear last year, when the 15-inch model was announced several months after the 13-inch, sporting the same M2 chip. This joint announcement puts the two models on the same refresh cycle, where they should be.Even more pronounced is the very narrow gulf between the base 15-inch Air and 14-inch Pro. The specs are near-identical across the board, save for stated 22 hours of battery to the Air models’ 18 hours (you have more room to navigate with a thicker, heavier machine). The Pro also sports a Liquid Retina XDR display, which packs 3024 x 1964 pixels into less screen real estate than the Air’s 2880 x 1864.It’s hard to recommend the base Pro over the Air. The math changes if you feel the need to upgrade to the M3 Pro, however. At that point you’ll also want to factor in the fact that (somewhat ironically) the Airs are fanless, meaning there’s going to be a thermal bottleneck when you really start pushing the machine. That said, Apple loves to point out how difficult it is to trigger the fan during daily use, meaning most Air users won’t be bothered by its absence most of the time.Image Credits: Brian HeaterWhen it arrived last year, we declared the 13-inch the best MacBook for most. Since then, it only saw a true challenger in the form of the 15-inch model, which has since become my daily driver. The Air inherited the throne of true mainstream devices from the standard MacBook, and as they've flourished, Pro models have increasingly shifted to the margin. The only major change here is the upgraded chip, making the 2024 model little more than a refresh.In the world of consumer electronics, that's to be expected. Apple created the best-ever MacBook with the 2023 Air. It was a perfect storm of powerful silicon, great industrial design and lessons learned from recent hardware stumbles. Given all that, it's ultimately for the best that the company stuck to the formula here. As for the whole “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI"" bit -- that's pure marketing. Intel made the same claim at the end of last year with its new Meteor Lake chips.As far as generative AI's current consumer reach, most modern laptops and phones are -- at very least -- serviceable. For now, the conversation largely centers on future-proofing systems for the great leaps to come. It's certainly something top of mind for Apple, as the company looks to make its first major announcements on the subject later this year (June's WWDC seems as good a time as any).Great strides have been made in bringing generative AI to consumers. The day-to-day usefulness of such platforms is another question entirely, but getting the most out of them will require capable machines, and the new Airs fit the bill. There's novelty in the ability to run large language models (LLMs) locally, though most consumers will continue to rely on cloud-based processing when they use these models.Programmers who really want to dive in will likely be eyeing Pro models and other high-end machines. For most consumers, however, the Air continues to be the best MacBook -- and it's not even close.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/apple-macbook-air-m3-review/",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-m3-macbook-air-review-140029672.html,AAPL,0.133,0.031,0.835,0.9998,Positive,170.2050018310547,172.9250030517578,1.598073612080446,1

It cited Epic's past breaches of contract in the long-running legal dispute.Epic Games had sought to take advantage of landmark EU rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which kick in on Thursday and require Apple to open up its closed eco-system to rivals.Breton criticised Apple's decision.""Under the #DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers to silence developers. I have asked our services to look into Apple's termination of Epic's developer account as a matter of priority,"" he said on X social media platform.The European Commission had earlier on Thursday said it had asked Apple to explain its actions under the DMA.The EU executive will also evaluate whether Apple's actions comply with the DSA (Digital Services Act) and the P2B (Platform to Business Regulation), ""given the links between the developer programme membership and the App store as designated VLOP (very large online platform)"".Under the DSA, decisions suspending or terminating accounts have to be proportionate and with due regard to fundamental rights while the P2B requires a platform to notify a business user when terms and conditions are changed and before an account is closed.Apple reiterated its rights on Thursday.""Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate 'any or all of Epic Games' wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games' control at any time and at Apple's sole discretion',"" an Apple spokesperson said.""In light of Epic's past and ongoing behaviour, Apple chose to exercise that right.""Epic on Wednesday said Apple was removing one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store.

2024-03-08 18:08:00,European regulators want to question Apple after it blocks Epic Games app store,"LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators said they want to question Apple over accusations that it blocked video game company Epic Games from setting up its own app store, in a possible violation of digital rules that took effect in the 27-nation bloc Thursday.It's a fresh escalation of the high-stakes battle between the two companies. Epic, maker of the popular game Fortnite, has spent years fighting Apple’s exclusive control over the distribution of iPhone apps.Epic asserted Wednesday that Apple thwarted its attempt to set up its own iOS app marketplace to compete with Apple's App Store, calling it a breach of the EU's new Digital Markets Act.The sweeping set of rules, designed to stop big tech companies from cornering digital markets, have forced Apple to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the U.S. tech giant — a move it's long resisted.The European Commission, the EU's top antitrust watchdog, said in a statement Thursday that it has “requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.” The rules threaten penalties that could reach into the billions for violations.Apple has already been hit this week with a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting music streaming competition.The commission said it's “also evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise doubts on their compliance” with other EU regulations including the Digital Services Act, a second set of regulations in the bloc's digital rulebook that prohibit tech companies from ”arbitrary application"" of their terms and conditions.Epic contended that Apple was brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store that it planned to set up in Sweden to serve European Union users.It accused Apple of retaliating for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S.Apple said its action was justified because of Epic's previous unlawful actions and litigation that resulted in the U.S. court decision in 2021.Apple ousted Epic from its App Store after it tried to get around restrictions that Apple says protect the security and privacy of iPhone users, while also helping recoup some of the investment that powers one of the world’s most ubiquitous devices.“Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion,'"" Apple said in a statement. ""In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right.”",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/european-regulators-want-apple-blocks-112006135.html,AAPL,0.053,0.083,0.8640000000000001,-0.9337,Negative,169.07980346679688,172.2631072998047,1.8827226952821334,1
2024-03-08 18:04:00,Apple is making big App Store changes in Europe over new rules. Could it mean more iPhone hacking?,"Apple is opening small cracks in the iPhone's digital fortress as part of a regulatory clampdown in Europe that is striving to give consumers more choices — at the risk of creating new avenues for hackers to steal personal and financial information stored on the devices.The overhaul rolling out Thursday only in the European Union represents the biggest changes to the iPhone's App Store since Apple introduced the concept in 2008. Among other things, people in Europe can download iPhone apps from stores not operated by Apple and are getting alternative ways to pay for in-app transactions.European regulators are hoping the changes mandated by the Digital Markets Act, or DMA, will loosen the control that Big Tech's “digital gatekeepers” have gained over the products and services that consumers and businesses use as they become more dominant forces in everyday life.The measures took effect just days after EU regulators fined Apple nearly $2 billion (1.8 billion euros) for thwarting competition in the music streaming market.Apple has lashed out at the new regulations for unnecessary security risks to iPhone users in Europe, exposing them to more scams and other malicious attacks launched from apps downloaded from outside its ecosystems and raising the specter of more unsavory services peddling pornography, illegal drugs and other content that the company has long prohibited in its App Store.Despite trying to maintain security safeguards while also adhering to the new rules in the 27-nation bloc, Apple is warning that “the changes the DMA requires will inevitably cause a gap between the protections that Apple users outside of the EU can rely on and the protections available to users in the EU moving forward.”Apple’s warnings should be taken with a grain of salt, experts say.Managing mobile devices is “totally different” from third-party app stores, and Apple is “deliberately confusing it here to muddy the waters,” said Michael Veale, an associate professor at University College London who specializes in digital rights and regulation.“Apple’s App Store is not a proxy for corporate data security — apps within it regularly send data to insecure cloud servers, to hidden third-party trackers and much more,” he said.Some smaller tech companies like music streaming service Spotify and video game maker Epic Games also are attacking the ways Apple is complying with the DMA as little more than a facade that's making a “mockery” of the regulations' intent.“Rather than creating healthy competition and new choices, Apple’s new terms will erect new barriers and reinforce Apple’s stronghold over the iPhone ecosystem,"" Spotify, Epic and more than two dozen other companies and alliances wrote in a March 1 letter to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm overseeing the DMA.Epic, which makes the popular game Fortnite, also contends Apple is already brazenly violating the DMA by rejecting an alternative iPhone app store it planned to release in Sweden. Epic asserted Apple thwarted its attempt to compete as retaliation for scathing critiques posted by CEO Tim Sweeney, who spearheaded a mostly unsuccessful antitrust case against the iPhone App Store in the U.S.In response, EU regulators said Thursday that they want to question Apple over allegations it blocked Epic's app store. Apple was defiant, saying it “chose to exercise that right” to boot the app store based on Epic's past behavior.Europe's shifting digital landscape is forcing changes at other technology powerhouses such as Google and Facebook, but the new regulations strike at the core of Apple's philosophy of maintaining ironclad control over every aspect of its products.This “walled garden” approach conceived by late co-founder Steve Jobs begins with the meticulous design of the hardware and then extends into all the software powering it devices, as well as overseeing the commerce occurring on them.The approach built an empire with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue — success that Apple traces to the trust it has built through decades of vigilant management of the iPhone and other popular products such as the iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.Even Epic's Sweeney acknowledged that one of the reasons he uses an iPhone is because of the staunch security measures that Apple has deployed to thwart hackers and protect the privacy of its customers. That came during testimony in a May 2021 trial resulting in a U.S. judge ruling that the App Store isn't a monopoly.In that decision, the judge required Apple to begin allowing links to outside payment options inside iPhone apps in the U.S. It's a requirement that the company began to allow earlier this year after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal on that issue.Apple — which is making changes in Europe through an iPhone software update — still doesn't permit alternative iPhone app stores in the U.S. or more than 100 other countries outside the EU.European regulators appear convinced that the benefits consumers stand to reap from more competition will outweigh any increased security risks.One potential positive is lower prices for digital transactions within apps if competing stores charge lower commissions than the 15% to 30% fees Apple has been imposing for years.But critics are raising doubts that will happen because Apple still plans to charge fees after app downloads reach relatively low thresholds and have set up other hurdles that will make it daunting for alternative options to make significant inroads in Europe.Apple insists the security problems hatched by the DMA are so worrisome that it has been hearing from government agencies — especially those in defense, banking and emergency services — wanting to ensure they will be able to block employees with iPhones from accessing apps distributed from outside Apple's walled garden.“These agencies have all recognized that sideloading — downloading apps from outside the App Store — could compromise security and put government data and devices at risk,” Apple said.Veale, the digital expert, pushed back.“Any firm or government who believe ‘apps from the App Store are safe’ may need to refresh their security and data protection teams or policies,” he said.___AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed from London.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-making-big-app-store-095017332.html,AAPL,0.083,0.066,0.851,0.9695,Positive,169.02999877929688,171.89999389648438,1.6979205690789028,1
2024-03-08 18:00:00,Stocks to Avoid: 3 Companies You Have No Business Buying Today,"Overall, it’s certainly great for investors that we’ve entered the phase of the bull market in which nearly everyone is becoming much more upbeat about stocks. After all, it’s obviously much easier to make money now in the market than it was last year and many times easier than was the case in 2022.At the same time, however, it’s also becoming much easier to get enticed into buying stocks with poor fundamentals that are nevertheless rallying due to investors increased optimism. Of course, those who buy such equities often lose a great deal of money on them in the longer run, since selling names that you once passionately believed in is not always easy to do.Here are three stocks to avoid in order to prevent yourself from falling into that trap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisualsGameStop (NYSE:GME) rallied about 18% between Feb. 22 and the afternoon of March 6. However, there’s no evidence that the firm’s fundamental problems are easing.Specifically, the retailer’s main business of selling hard copies of video games is slowly disappearing since most such games are being downloaded now. And while the company is also generating significant revenue by selling collectibles such as figures and coins, the latter business is commoditized and consequently not very profitable.Some may be enticed by the board’s decision to allow the firm to buy the stocks of other firms. But given the decisions by CEO Ryan Cohen to invest in Bed, Bath, and Beyond, which subsequently went bankrupt, and his purchase of GME stock itself, I would not expect big returns from the firm’s stock-purchasing programs.Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a Feb. 9 column,  “Sinking U.S. fertility rates are likely to undermine the businesses of companies whose products are primarily used by children.” After reporting that from 2007 to 2022, the birth rate tumbled nearly 23%.” I identified toy maker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) as one of the firms that was being undermined by the latter trend. Hasbro’s fourth-quarter results, reported on Feb. 13, show that its struggles continued late last year. Indeed, its top line tumbled 23% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.29 billion. Moreover, its net loss ballooned to $1.06 billion last quarter from $129 million in Q4 of 2023.Additionally, since many of today’s millennial parents are probably much more likely to be concerned about the impact of exposing their children to violent toys, chances are high that they are less likely to encourage their children to play with war-oriented toys than preceding generations of parents. The latter trend, in turn, is negative for HAS, which markets  G.I. Joe and Star Wars toys.Finally, toys have generally been getting much cheaper in recent years, probably due to increases in the amount of toys imported from developing countries. The latter trend, of course, is also negative for Hasbro and HAS stock.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comCirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) has historically obtained almost 80% of its revenue from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The latter tech giant incorporates Cirrus’ “audio chips and IC controllers” into most of its hardware.And the demand for Apple’s iPhones in China, its second-largest market, has reportedly been sinking. Indeed, iPhone unit sales in the Asian country reportedly tumbled “24% in the first six weeks of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.”Also noteworthy is that, although Apple’s revenue from its iPhone sales rose 8% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, the figure was slightly below the peak reached in the final calendar quarter of 2021.Of course, a sharp decline of iPhone sales in China would very bad news for Cirrus, which obtains a small amount of revenue for each iPhone handed over to consumers.Despite these issues, CRUS stock has advanced nearly 20% since early February.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-08 17:37:00,EU regulators take an interest in Apple-Epic Games dispute,"European Union (EU) regulators seek to question Apple (AAPL) over the tech giant's termination of the Epic Games Store from its App Store. European officials view this to be in violation of the EU’s Digital Markets Act.Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the latest in the legal conflict between the Fortnite creator and Apple.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Apple is facing more regulatory scrutiny. EU regulators are set to question Apple on its recent feud with Epic Games and its App Store rules. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley to give us the details. So Dan, walk us through where we are now and how we got here.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. So we'll start from how we got here. This basically all comes back to Epic Games and Apple's showdown where Epic wanted to provide consumers with a third party means of purchasing items inside of games. Apple doesn't allow that through the App Store. When Epic went ahead and did that on their own, Apple basically pulled Fortnite and suspended Epic Games from being able to use the App Store.Epic, knowing that this would happen, sued Apple. And then basically in California, what ended up happening was Apple was not found to be a monopolist, but it did have what the court said were some anti-steering rules. And so they had to address those.Now, where this recent spat comes from is the EU and the Digital Markets Act. And Apple basically says that look, we can't trust Epic. We need to put in place a kind of a block from them. We're not going to let them use our platforms because of the prior issues we've had with them. And Epic saying, look, the Digital Markets Act, which allows for third party app stores on things like iOS is in place, and we should be allowed to put our App Store there.So what we're hearing from the two companies is basically obviously completely opposite. So first, we have a statement from Epic where they say, ""Apple is taking one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store,"" which would be that Epic Games Store. ""They are undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.""Now, essentially what Epic is saying there is, look, CEO Tim Sweeney went ahead, criticized Apple and its Digital Markets Act maneuvers as well as its moves in the US. And they're saying that that's why Apple is not letting Epic run any App Store on iOS in the EU.Now, Apple on the flip side had this to say. Epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate any or all of Epic Games', wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games control at any time. Apple chose to exercise that right.""That comes from that California court ruling. And so you know how that exactly plays out with the EU, I don't know. But it really comes down to two companies that are just at loggerheads over what they believe they should be allowed to do on iOS. And for Apple, they're not going to give this up, obviously. This is something that they're going to hold onto.They're trying to make moves that allow them to continue to remain in control of iOS and the App Store. And for Epic, look, they have a mountain of money from Fortnite, and so they're going to go ahead and continue to fight this as well. What it ends up doing is making Apple look bad and making Epic look bad so we'll see if either or decides to pull back or doesn't or if the EU makes some decision. Now, they're starting to probe Apple on its decision to pull Epic Games' ability to put games onto the App Store in the EU.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly a legal battle when you consider the California ruling versus what the EU is looking at in terms of the disproportionate or proportionate reaction that Apple had. Are we expecting to see more of these sorts of these challenges when it comes to the App Store and Apple trying to maintain its dominance while still trying to stay within the rules here?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, look, when it comes to the $2 billion that they were fined from the EU over Apple Music and Spotify, Apple says that they're going to appeal that. And so clearly, they're not going to just take this lying down. They're going to continue to try to I guess work through what the EU's rules are but to the limit, right? And so that appears to be what they're intent on doing.They don't want to give up making money off of the App Store or the way they do now through commissions from developers when there's sales of their products or apps themselves. And so you got to imagine that they're going to continue to try to fight this as much as they can while still sticking to the law.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/eu-regulators-takes-interest-apple-173722879.html,AAPL,0.046,0.06,0.894,-0.9527,Negative,169.25999450683594,172.39999389648438,1.8551338128051411,1

2024-03-08 16:59:00,Welcome to the Digital Markets Act. Here’s what you need to know about the EU’s new Big Tech antitrust law,"Europe’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) finally started hitting Big Tech with tough antitrust obligations today. And what better way to understand its impact than to look at how tech firms have moved to comply—and to take advantage of new opportunities?But first, here’s what happens if these so-called gatekeepers—which so far include Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and TikTok parent ByteDance—don’t comply. They can get hit with fines of up to 10% of global annual revenue. If they keep breaking the rules, those fines can rise to 20%, and the European Commission can even break businesses up or block them from buying other companies relating to whatever naughtiness is concerned.It’s worth noting that, in light of how weak enforcement by underfunded national regulators undermined the bite of the EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation, which deals with privacy, the Commission has decided to enforce the DMA itself. The same goes for its sister law, the Digital Services Act, which mostly deals with content-moderation issues. It remains to be seen whether the Commission has the resources to do this effectively for either law, but that’s the plan.Got that? Cool. Let’s proceed with the changes themselves—and remember, these are Europe-only.Moving easily to rival services. Many companies have been letting users download their data for years now, but now they’re going beyond that. For example, Google and TikTok owner ByteDance have launched data portability APIs so users can give other developers permission to directly import their data from the gatekeepers’ services—handy for switching service providers, but also potentially for backing up their data.Freedom from default choices. Remember when Microsoft was once forced to tell Windows users that they had browser options beyond Internet Explorer, like Google’s Chrome? Now Chrome will tell its users that they have other search engine options. And Google will also give Android users a choice of browsers and search engines when they set up their device.More control over data privacy. Continuing the inexorable bleeding together of data-protection and competition law, people now get to decide if one of these Big Tech conglomerates can keep linking together the data from accounts users have with its various services—something that has big implications for user profiling and ad targeting. So Meta now lets people decouple Facebook and Instagram accounts, and Google does the same for YouTube, Search, and its many other services.Choice of in-app payment services. Google and Apple now let app developers deploy third-party payment mechanisms that aren’t Google Pay and Apple Pay. Google mostly did this in 2022 already, though it’s only now fully expanded the program to game developers. Apple left everything until the last minute. But hey, third-party developers can actually access the iPhone’s NFC tap-to-pay chip now!Interoperability of services. Gatekeepers don’t have to make their services interoperable with just anyone—nobody wants security to go out the window—but they do need to allow it in principle. So, for example, users of Meta’s WhatsApp will soon be able to talk to people on other messaging platforms. (Meta is trying to avoid the same obligation for its Messenger service.)Business data transparency. Business customers of these platforms can now demand easier access to the data they generate. This looks set to have a real impact in the advertising space, as both Google and Amazon are now promising to give advertisers and publishers more data.No more anti-steering. Well hello there, Apple. Days after the company was fined $2 billion for refusing to let Spotify and other streaming services inform their iOS users about cheaper off-platform subscription deals, the new rules demand more clearly that gatekeepers let business users “promote offers and conclude contracts with customers outside the gatekeeper’s platform.” So that’s definitely now a thing, although Google is trying the interesting tactic of claiming fat fees for these “external offers,” as it calls them. I imagine developers will complain to the Commission about that. But speaking of Apple …Third-party app stores. Google already allowed third-party app stores on Android, and as of now, Apple must do the same on iOS. The first third party, whose German developers have promised a launch as soon as the DMA comes into force (it isn’t live yet), is Mobivention, which focuses on the enterprise market. MacPaw’s Setapp should follow in April.However, Apple celebrated the advent of the DMA by denying archnemesis Epic Games’ attempt to launch a European iOS app store and bring Fortnite back to European iPhones. I don’t have space to explain why here—but you can find my comprehensive explainer here. Tl;dr: Apple’s DMA-compliance hissy fit over the past couple months has somehow become even more outrageous, and it’s unlikely to pay off for the company. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager just released a video celebrating the advent of the DMA, and it pointedly referred to Fortnite returning to iOS. I checked with her staff, and she definitely recorded it after Apple’s latest tantrum.More news below.David MeyerWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/welcome-digital-markets-act-know-165928358.html,AAPL,0.085,0.05,0.866,0.9858,Positive,169.22000122070312,171.49000549316406,1.341451516419925,1

2024-03-08 15:07:00,Stocks rip higher off shifting tech sentiments after selloff,"Wall Street traders are all in agreement that the stock market indices (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are ripping higher Thursday morning. Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills is joined by Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to comment on the upside reeling from tech sell-offs.Healthcare, industrials, materials, those are doing well, despite some of the Mag 7 — three in particular, Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) — down for the year,"" Woods states. That usually scares this market, it's not. So something's changed and it's a good narrative.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.[BELL RINGING]- There it is. We did it again. That's the opening bell on Wall Street and at the NASDAQ in Midtown Manhattan where they've got some funfetti because it's a day that ends in Y, Pentair ringing the opening bell at the NYSE, ticker symbol PNT. And in Midtown Manhattan you've got we're going to go with Energem.- OK. I like that pronunciation.- You like that one?- Yeah.- OK. All right, we'll stick with that one for now. We'll workshop it a little bit here in the break. We've got team coverage of the biggest market movers following the opening bell on Wall Street standing by at the New York Stock Exchange. We've got Jay Woods alongside Madison Mills and Jared Blikre, who is here at the Wi-Fi interactive on standby,Madison, just 30 minutes before Fed Chair Jay Powell's second day of congressional testimony kicks off, what are you hearing around the exchange?- Well, Brad, I'm here with Jay Woods, who I'd love to get that quote of what you just said. What did you say when you just turned to the boards?- I said, we're ripping.- What's going on?- Hey, did I curse? If I did, I don't want to quote that. What's going on-- we're having a nice day here. Remember Monday and Tuesday when we sold off? This is the third time we've had close to a 2% selloff from the top of the S&P 500. We haven't had a 2% selloff in now, I believe, 90 days, where there have only been six streaks longer, which is quite impressive.And every time you think we're going to give a little bit back, the buyers step in and we're stepping in again despite Powell's testimony where we're going to be a little higher for longer. So this market's resilient and, yeah, it's pretty amazing to see.- So we had the selloff, and then we have this catalyst for growth. What is driving this growth that we're still seeing off of that selloff?- Well, we're seeing a rotation. We had a good earnings season. We got through that. We still have a few coming out later today, but 99% are done. So let's say we're done.And now, we're waiting for that next catalyst. What's that going to be? I think it's going to be the CPI next week, unemployment tomorrow. But right now, despite inflation still being a little sticky and higher for longer, the market is resilient, and the broadening out, we're seeing the Russell still continue to do well.Health care, industrials, materials, those are doing well, despite some of the Mag Seven, three of them in particular-- Tesla, Apple, and Google-- down for the year. Tesla down over 20%, Apple down over 10%. That usually scares this market. It's not, so something's changed, and it's a good narrative.- If you're an investor who has those three names that you mentioned and maybe even I would throw in a Microsoft-- they're kind of surviving, but I feel like they're not thriving the way the other top three in the seven are-- what's your advice to them? What should they be thinking about and framing their thinking on? Should they be panicking right now?- Well, if that's their only stock holding, yeah, I'd be a little nervous because you're missing out on the rest of the rally. But, I mean, Apple has proven time and time again that any pause, any stop in their uptrend is probably a good buying opportunity.Tesla a little different. Google, they have some AI concerns, but Google has always figured it out as well. So what it is just a rotation, and people are going to different asset classes, whether it's Bitcoin and gold-- which are making all-time highs. It's crazy-- or some of the other smaller stocks that have not participated yet in the rally.And then you have AI. It just doesn't slow down. NVIDIA over 900 this morning. Crazy.- When you look at AI plays, I was just talking about Micron Technology, what should investors be looking at in terms of the fundamentals, the balance sheet on these companies to suss out where they can afford to play AI if they can't get in on NVIDIA?- Yeah, well, I mean, you can buy the SMH, the Semiconductor Index, that's a best way to have a basket of stocks that are all AI related. NVIDIA definitely the best in class. Who's the next one up? We have Broadcom earnings after the close today. It's going to be interesting to see what they do.NVIDIA was up 260% coming into this week over 52 weeks. You know, Broadcom symbol AVGO was up 135%, so you do have stocks that are making tremendous runs in AI, but NVIDIA just outshines everybody. It's best in class, and it's best in class for a reason. They keep raising the bar.The AI story, as Dan Ives always says-- I know he's been on your network and talked to you guys in the studio-- it's still early innings, and I believe Dan Ives. And you just have to be selective. If you want to get in, buy a basket. It's the best way to play it.- All right. Buy that basket. Thank you so much, Jay. We really appreciate you. As always, Brad and Seana, I'll toss it back to you guys in the studio.- All right. Thanks so much, Maddy, and thanks, Jay, for telling us how to play the movement that we're seeing to the upside. Buy the basket.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/video/stocks-rip-higher-off-shifting-150753693.html,AAPL,0.115,0.028999999999999998,0.855,0.9982,Positive,169.2899932861328,171.4875030517578,1.2980742233894378,1
2024-03-08 14:56:00,"Apple, Google forced to make sweeping changes in Europe: What it means for you","TheStreet’s J.D. Durkin brings the latest business headlines from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as markets open for trading Thursday, March 7.J.D. DURKIN: I’m J.D. Durkin - reporting from the New York Stock Exchange. Here’s what we’re watching on TheStreet today.Investors are looking ahead to day two of Powell’s testimony on the Hill – Wall Street will be listening closely for hints on the Fed’s path forward on interest rates.Investors are also digesting weekly jobless claims, which came in roughly in line with analyst expectations at 217,000… but investors are awaiting key data on the labor market when the February jobs report drops Friday.In other news - big changes have officially gone into effect when it comes to how European consumers interact with some of the world’s biggest tech companies. Those companies will now be forced to follow more stringent rules when it comes to their competitive practices.Just a few of the changes include Apple allowing users in the EU to download apps from third-party app stores, for the first time since Apple launched its own 15 years ago. Meanwhile, Google will be forced to drive more traffic to other shopping or travel-booking sites instead of directing users to its own platforms. And Meta might be forced to integrate messages from other messaging apps, like Signal or Viber, into its Messenger and WhatsApp services.The sweeping changes will affect six of the biggest names in tech: Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Bytedance - which owns TikTok. And if a company is found to have broken any of the newly implemented rules, it’s going to cost them. First-time offenders could be fined up 10 percent of the company’s global revenue, while a second offense could cost them as much as 20 percent.That’ll do it for your daily briefing.

2024-03-07 18:28:00,Magnificent 7 Price Targets: What Each of These Stocks Could Be Worth in 2030,"The Magnificent 7 stocks have captivated investors over the past few months with their meteoric rise. These heavyweight tech names have propelled much of the market’s gains in recent years. But not all of the Magnificent 7 have delivered equally magnificent returns. While titans like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continue charging ahead, stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have lagged.Yet, even amidst their mixed trajectories, it’s worth taking a step back to consider where each of these influential stocks could be headed over the long-run. As they scale to new heights, momentum seems to be driving share prices more than fundamentals. That’s often a sign of overvaluation. Many believe a meaningful correction could hit some of these names in the coming months or weeks.That said, I remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for these innovative companies. By 2030, they could each reach entirely new levels if they maintain dominance in their core markets. But how high could each stock realistically climb? Let’s take a look!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple has lagged behind its Magnificent 7 peers, and for good reason. This stalwart has not fully embraced the AI and data boom powering much of the recent gains in this group. With iPhone sales plateauing, Apple looks like a company stuck in the past to many investors. Losing its crown as the largest company to Microsoft only added insult to injury.However, underneath the surface, Apple has quietly built a foundation for future growth. Its new Vision Pro VR headset, despite a hefty $3,499 starting price, has sold over 200,000 units as of the end of January, exceeding expectations. VR and AR remain early-stage markets, so the demand for this product has limits for now. But Apple is laying the groundwork in a potentially massive arena.Meanwhile, Apple recently bested Q4 expectations, proving reports of its demise were premature. Critics argue the company is still too slow in pursuing AI. However, with Apple snapping up AI startups and making key hires, bears may soon be proven wrong. This sleeping giant could rejoin the party in the coming years. If Apple capitalizes on its strengths in hardware and combines it with AI expertise, the stock could eclipse $500 by 2030.Source: alexfan32 / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains a top Magnificent 7 buy. Yes, its premium valuation of 43-times earnings and 3-times sales raises eyebrows. But the company’s growth prospects justify these multiples. Analysts forecast Amazon’s earnings per share will triple from 2024 to 2033 amid double-digit revenue growth. I believe Amazon could even exceed these projections.Several factors drive this potential. AWS maintains strong demand as cloud adoption rises. Additionally, Amazon’s AI investments are starting to bear fruit across its divisions. The company is firing on all cylinders – even making healthcare inroads via Amazon Pharmacy and the OneMedical acquisition. E-commerce leadership provides a wide moat. Developing in-house chips will also result in massive cost declines for the company’s chip needs in its AWS segment.This is a business executing on all fronts. AI permeates every segment, from e-commerce to pharma. Amazon simply has too many levers to pull in too many growing markets to be stopped. I see AMZN stock reaching $750 or more by 2030, depending on how far into the future markets are willing to extrapolate this growth story.Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) has lagged behind its peers in capitalizing on AI, but it is catching up fast. Concerns have emerged as ChatGPT seemed poised to disrupt the company’s core Google search business. But neither ChatGPT nor Bing made a dent in Google’s supremacy. Meanwhile, Alphabet has kept its head down developing its own powerful AI.Upgrading Bard with Gemini showcased Alphabet’s progress. Then came Gemma and Gemini Ultra, which the company claims is the most advanced model yet – even surpassing GPT-4. The validity of this claim is uncertain. But clearly, Alphabet has closed the AI gap. Google Cloud growth also underscores its momentum, with Q4 revenue up 26% to $9.2 billion.Alphabet appears well-positioned for the AI age after weathering the ChatGPT threat. Google search retains its dominance, as the company expands into new technologies. With the company firing on all cylinders again, I see substantial upside ahead. If the company maintains momentum in cloud and AI, GOOG stock could fetch more than $400 per share by 2030. For a stock that’s lagged its peers, the future looks increasingly bright for Alphabet moving forward.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comI’ve long been bullish on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) despite the stock market’s harsh treatment of the stock in 2022. Shares plunged below $100 as Meta invested heavily in its future vision. I pounded the table on META stock from $120 down to $90 before its sharp rebound.Meta’s bets on AR and VR seem premature today. These technologies remain in their early stages of development, with limited near-term returns. But Meta’s core apps – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp – are cash cows. Yes, teenagers shun Facebook. However, social media networks are still seeing overall user growth. And notably, Instagram and WhatsApp have young demographics locked down.As I wrote in October, Meta’s valuation looked fair based on 2023 estimates. Had Meta paid dividends over investing in the metaverse, it may have appealed more to long-term shareholders. Lo and behold, Meta recently initiated a dividend – making it more attractive to additional investor types.My 2025 target of $400 proved conservative as shares hit $500 in early March. But I now believe $850 per share is achievable by 2030. That’s a modest projection, given Meta likely cools off after this breakout over fair value.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft has rocketed higher since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. Its AI investments via OpenAI sparked today’s hype. Indeed, Microsoft 365 remains essential for office productivity. By combining its software suite with AI, Microsoft is enabling more and more efficiency.Its data center business is booming as well. Microsoft’s AI investments across its business units are paying dividends. This stalwart should stay vital for the foreseeable future, delivering further upside. A $1,200 target by 2030 seems reasonable given Microsoft’s expansive reach, as the company makes big bets in emerging fields like quantum computing.Microsoft has its hands in every facet of tech. The company has defined past eras of computing and appears positioned to capitalize on the next wave of innovation too.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comI’m bearish on Nvidia in the near-term. Semiconductors are cyclical, but investors get carried away and became downright euphoric during the recent AI-fueled rally. We saw huge gains this past year that I expect to reverse, much like the 2000 dot-com bubble.Several headwinds face Nvidia investors. Many tech giants are developing their own AI chips rather than buying from Nvidia. With these firms also backing AI startups, Nvidia’s dominance in this space may wane. Moreover, rivals like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) are rolling out powerful new AI chips. It’s only a matter of time before they catch up.Nvidia remains a momentum stock today. I believe long-term holders can still profit, but likely after weathering steep losses first. Even with these headwinds, $1,300 per share by 2030 seems achievable for NVDA stock.Source: franz12 / Shutterstock.comTesla has lagged behind its Magnificent 7 peers recently. But don’t count this EV giant out over the long-term. The culprit driving this recent decline has been rising rates and tight money weighing on the EV sector. Once rates drop, Tesla and its peers should see growth reaccelerate.Consider Tesla’s massive runway. Only 1% of vehicles are electric today. Tesla has no serious U.S. competitors. And while overseas rivals are gaining steam, they’re unlikely to ever dominate the U.S. market, with most such foreign competitors focusing on hybrids anyway. As the U.S. moves to electrify its fleet in the coming decades, Tesla remains the EV giant to beat.Tesla also leads in batteries, charging infrastructure, and technology. It has carved an enviable niche that should propel growth once macro conditions improve.The stock may tread water until rates decline. But with most of the company’s future growth still ahead, Tesla charging toward a $600+ level by 2030 seems reasonable.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2024-03-07 17:28:00,SEC adopts landmark climate rule — here's what that means for public companies,"For the first time, US public companies will be required to tell investors about their exposure to climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions.On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved requiring US-listed companies to communicate how they are managing material risks related to climate change and how those risks affect their bottom lines. Large companies will also be required to disclose their direct emissions from their operations and energy use, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.""I think it's important for the US to have its own standards based on US law, based on the economics of our markets, based upon what investors here are using to make investment decisions, and I think today's action is that important step for our US capital markets,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said during the meeting. ""These roles will enhance the disclosures that investors have been relying on to make their investment decisions. Issuers and investors will benefit from the consistency, comparability, reliability of these disclosures.""The measure passed 3-2 along political lines following two years of review and over 24,000 comments on the proposal.The SEC notably pared back the final ruling, trimming a provision that would have required companies to report their Scope 3 impact — that is, indirect emissions from suppliers and consumers.The Scope 3 standard faced considerable resistance from conservatives and business groups who complained about high compliance costs and overreach, while climate-focused investors and lawmakers pushed for the SEC to include Scope 3 to help crack down on companies downplaying their full environmental impact.SEC's exclusion of Scope 3 data is considered a win for many businesses given that indirect emissions make up the largest and fastest-growing category of emissions.Scope 3 categories include emissions from purchased goods, employee commutes, projects financed, and the use of products sold, among others. In the oil and gas sector, Scope 3 emissions can account for up to 95% of emissions; in financial services companies, the figure is even higher at up to 99%.Nevertheless, the landmark ruling by Wall Street's top regulator sets mandatory requirements — detailed in the SEC press release — that provide greater consistency, comparability, and reliability in climate data so that investors and consumers can make more informed decisions.""I think what's kind of most important is that the information begins to flow,"" Bryan McGannon, managing director at US SIF (the Sustainable Investment Forum), told Yahoo Finance. ""So even if it doesn't include Scope 3 information, investors are going to get, for the first time, companies reporting their climate risk.""Josh Griffin, co-founder and chief policy officer at NZero, a climate data platform, told Yahoo Finance that companies are ""seeing that their customers want a better understanding, and it’s showing up in market choices. Companies that not only invest in technologies to reduce their emissions but [also] are transparent about their efforts are being rewarded by their customers. This is where these regulatory requirements from the SEC are so vital because they create consistency and shared expectations.""The landmark rule will affect thousands of companies, many of which already provide this information publicly on a voluntary basis or to comply with other regulations.Companies will now face four main types of disclosure requirements when they register with the SEC and in their annual reports: what their climate risks are, how they are adapting to those risks, how the board of directors is overseeing climate strategy, and how climate targets will affect the business.Large non-exempt companies will also have to list their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Many already track that information: As of 2022, nearly all S&P 500 companies and 90% of Russell 1000 companies published sustainability reports, according to the Governance & Accountability Institute.""There are fairly well-established methods for being able to build out Scope 1 [data],"" Rob Fisher, the US ESG Leader at KPMG, told Yahoo Finance. ""Scope 2, frequently, it's not overly complicated. There are many aggregation services ... that are able to get your Scope 2 emissions.""The SEC expects large corporations such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Exxon (XOM) to begin reporting their climate risk-related information in their fiscal year 2025 and to report their greenhouse gas emissions by fiscal year 2026. They will also need to submit a limited third-party review of their emissions data by 2029 and a full audit by 2033.Smaller companies and emerging growth companies will have an additional two years to disclose their climate risks and will not be required to report their emissions, which provides space for new technological developments to evolve.""The climate rule [that] got issued in March 2022 was basically before the rise of generative AI,"" KPMG's Fisher noted. ""And now, you know, things have kind of gone crazy. … So, I think the intersection of AI and this new reporting requirement is quite interesting because we can do some things very differently now in how we address the rule this time around than we could last time.""Fisher noted that for ""most organizations, building out a Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse-gas inventory is certainly not trivial, depending on the scope and size of the operation. But certainly ... the big thing is that the data generally resides inside the virtual four walls of the organization.""How prepared they actually are to meet these requirements is not entirely clear. A KPMG survey found that 4 out of 5 companies say they are ahead of their peers when it comes to sustainability reporting, yet nearly half still lean on spreadsheets to manage data instead of advanced data systems.""The tools are more readily available and more seamless for companies to gather their Scope 1 and 2 emissions,"" nZero's Griffin said. ""Scope 3 still presents a lot of challenges because of jurisdictional issues, but the market for collecting such data has also grown quite a bit in the last two years.""The SEC's rule marks a step up in climate disclosure requirements, and it's been a long time coming.Since 1971, the SEC has recommended that companies communicate the cost of complying with environmental regulations. In 2010, the agency went further to suggest that companies should voluntarily provide details about their exposure to climate risks, if material.Increasing extreme weather events, scrutiny around inflated sustainability claims, and pressure from activists, investors, and governments only heightened the pressure for mandatory disclosures.By 2021, the SEC began seeking feedback on the shape of climate disclosure policy. When it released its draft proposal in March 2022, it drew polarized responses from groups on both sides of the aisle that only intensified as ESG investing became a political lightning rod.And while the rule has been finalized, the issue is far from settled. Lawsuits against the SEC are virtually guaranteed, experts say, something Gensler has been preparing for.Although the removal of the Scope 3 rule may lessen the risk of litigation from the US Chamber of Commerce, American Farm Bureau Federation, and National Association of Manufacturers, it could provoke the opposite reaction from green groups.""I think what has taken them long to come to the final rule was to make sure that what was in the final rule is as durable as possible to withstand litigation challenge,"" US SIF's McGannon said. ""I think they went to really great lengths to ensure that the rule would stand.""Companies have also been closely watching whether the SEC's rule would align with disclosure requirements that have gained traction around the world or else join what Fisher called a ""patchwork quilt"" of regulations that collectively raise compliance costs.One benchmark is the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which took effect on Jan. 5, 2023. The EU law has a broader definition of materiality that includes human and environmental impacts as well as financial impacts. The EU also mandates reporting of Scope 3 emissions, which the SEC stopped short of.The United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Hong Kong have also set climate reporting standards. And earlier this year, China hinted at joining them.Then there's California's climate disclosure law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in October 2023, which made the state the first in the US to approve such a measure. It also set the stage for legislators in New York and Illinois to follow suit with their own climate disclosure bills.California's two climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, go much further by requiring disclosures from both private and public companies that do business in the state. Those with revenues over $500 million must publish their climate risk plans, and those with over $1 billion in revenue are required to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions.The effect is that many large multinationals or companies with operations in California will be required to report Scope 3 emissions even if the SEC is not requiring them to do so.""Scope 3 may be out of the SEC’s climate rule but it’s very much in scope for US multinationals and likely many private companies,"" Fisher wrote in an email following the decision. ""The SEC’s rule followed actions of the EU, California, and the ISSB, all of which require Scope 3 reporting.

2024-03-07 16:26:00,Apple Looks Most Oversold in Years After $200 Billion Selloff,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has struggled in 2024, and the recent weakness has the stock looking like it is the most oversold in years, analysts said.Most Read from BloombergChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, ClearasilNikki Haley Ends 2024 Bid, Setting Up Trump-Biden RematchNew York to Deploy National Guard to NYC Subways to Fight CrimeStocks and Bonds Climb as Powell Sticks to Script: Markets WrapEgypt’s Devaluation and Record Rate Hike Put IMF Deal in ReachShares of the iPhone maker are down 14% from a recent peak and have dropped 12% this year, compared with a gain of 7.42% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. Apple shares have been pressured by concerns over iPhone sales in China and a fine from the European Union.The stock fell 0.3% on Wednesday, its sixth straight negative session. The 7.2% decline over that six-day drop has erased more than $200 billion in market capitalization.“At some point this hate is going to be too much, and most oversold in six years seems like a good place to start,” Michael Toomey, head of TMT trading at Jefferies LLC, wrote in a note to clients.He said the length of the stock’s underperformance relative to the Nasdaq 100 has been notable, adding that “feels like every day we get another negative AAPL datapoint, and it’s not particularly cheap.”Jefferies looked at the relative strength index of long Apple positions versus short positions in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. Based on this, “this is the most oversold AAPL/QQQ has been since early 2018.”Bespoke Investment Group LLC wrote in a post on X that Apple is more than three standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, and that “it hasn’t been this oversold since March 16th, 2020 in the throes of the COVID crash.”Even with the stock’s recent weakness, Apple shares trade near 25 times estimated earnings, above their 10-year average multiple of 19.Despite the selloff, options traders are showing few signs of fear, buoyed by the broader optimism about the biggest technology stocks.Implied volatility for three-month options has picked up from recent lows, but is around the middle of the range for the past year. And the put skew, measuring the premium investors will pay for protection against a decline, is holding near a two-year low.--With assistance from David Marino.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplaceImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for WorkersThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairWhy Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-looks-most-oversold-years-162621064.html,AAPL,0.05,0.078,0.872,-0.9402,Negative,169.93020629882812,169.30499267578125,-0.3679237709789014,0

Jared, what are you seeing?JARED BLIKRE: Well, I'm seeing a marked difference from yesterday. You can see tech express through the NASDAQ, and also the Russell 2000, small caps, both up 1%, clawing back some of those big losses we had yesterday.As you were saying earlier, earlier in the year, January 2 was the last time we had a tech sell-off in XLK of that strength. But then, look what's number one today, XLK up 1% followed by E for energy, then materials, communication, services, and real estate. All of those outperforming. In fact, as you can see, everything in the green here.And just kind of continuing on Mady's theme of the bifurcation that we see in the Mag Seven, and just in general in big tech, there is Apple. Really stands out. It's trading to the downside, not by a lot. But just check out this one-year chart. I've been tracking this support level here at about $165. And we are heading down to that level, just about $5 away.And on a three-year basis, you can see, if we break this level probably heading to what-- $150, $125-- something in there. So this does have repercussions. Apple is still a very important bellwether stock for the market.Do want to mention bonds here quickly, because we have the 10-year T-note yield hovering near one-month lows. You'd have to go back to February to see what's happening there. In terms of the price level, that's 4.12% for that rate. It's down one basis point there. We've been seeing rates go down. And it's unusual in that the NASDAQ usually does the opposite of what rates do, but we've seen kind of the opposite with that recently.All right, just with a few seconds to go, I want to check out what's happening with crypto. Give you a quick pick-- there we go. Quick peek at the Bitcoin price, $67,178.

2024-03-06 20:50:00,Apple Shares Are Tanking. Here Are Levels Traders Are Watching,"(Bloomberg) — Traders are eyeing Apple Inc. after its stock slid below a critical psychological threshold on Tuesday as shares entered a technical correction for the first time since August this month.Most Read from BloombergApple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales PlungeTech Giants Drag Down US Stocks After Torrid Rally: Markets WrapGold Climbs to Record as Momentum Builds on Bets Over Fed PivotOlivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly? Don't Act Surprised.America Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop.The shares, which failed to hold the $180 support level last week, traded for less than $170 at various points during Tuesday’s session. Breaking through that level and holding there could presage a pullback to its October low of $165.67, according to Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities.“Apple is one of the most influential stocks so it may see a bounce from here in the short-run after being oversold,” Sohn said over the phone. “But traders may still look to fade it at $180 because its trend has deteriorated so much.”Shares of the Cupertino, California-based company have shed nearly 12% this year after closing at a record in December, erasing more than $300 billion in market value. That’s cost Apple its crown as the most valuable US company to Microsoft Corp., as some of its Big Tech peers like Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. keep rallying.Apple is facing a slew of issues, including regulatory scrutiny of its App Store, declining sales in China and investor concerns over its growth prospects. Its fourth-quarter outlook also raised worries due to tepid demand for its handsets and other gadgets.Naturally, short sellers are pouncing. Apple was the the stock market’s second-most profitable short position in February at $606 million in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners.Read more: Apple Shorts Eye Key $180 Level With CautionWith Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that technology shares broadly may face pressure in the coming months, even with Nvidia’s dominance. The iPhone maker continues to set new lows relative to the $252 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, ticker QQQ, that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index.That said, Birinyi Associates found that Apple’s correlation to the S&P 500 isn’t as tight as some may think. On a scale where 1 means a perfect directional relationship and 0 indicates no relationship at all, Apple clocks in at 0.65 compared with 0.69 for Nvidia and 0.36 for the average S&P stock, according to Jeff Rubin, director of research at Birinyi.From a technical perspective, this means the US stock market can continue to churn higher as long as Apple’s stock doesn’t break its multi-year uptrend from its 2020 lows, according to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.“While this isn’t an intermediate-term concern, and there’s ample evidence that ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks can certainly carry markets higher without the aid of Apple,” Newton wrote in a note to clients. “I view all weakness in Apple over the next month as likely making this stock quite attractive.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplaceImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for WorkersPrivate Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a DatabaseThe Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace DoorsChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-shares-tanking-levels-traders-202301385.html,AAPL,0.076,0.061,0.8640000000000001,0.8354,Positive,170.01699829101562,169.05999755859375,-0.5628853244331433,-1
2024-03-06 19:46:00,VUG vs. VGT: Which Tech-Heavy ETF Is the Better Buy?,"ETFs allow investors to diversify their capital without much effort. Fund managers either take an active approach and carefully monitor individual positions or align their funds with established benchmarks. Vanguard is one of the leading firms that specializes in these types of funds. This article will dive into two popular Vanguard funds, one of which is tech-heavy, while the other is tech-exclusive: the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).I am bullish on both of these funds, but it’s important to know the nuances of each fund before getting started. This article will examine their similarities and differences so you can decide which one makes sense for you.Both of these funds have been neck-and-neck over the past year. VGT is up by 48.2%, while VUG has gained 47.8%. There is a larger gap between the funds when looking at five-year performances. While VGT gained 166.1% during that time, VUG was only up by 121.6%.Even though VGT has been the clear winner over the past five years, it’s hard to complain about the performance of either of these funds.Investors don’t even have to worry much about these funds’ expense ratios eating away the returns. Vanguard is well-known for having low expense ratios for its funds, and the brokerage firm certainly delivers for these picks. VUG has a 0.04% expense ratio, while VGT has a 0.10% expense ratio.There’s more to VUG and VGT than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, these two stocks are the largest positions in both funds by wide margins.VUG offers more portfolio diversification for assets outside of these two tech giants. Microsoft makes up 13.2% of the fund’s total holdings, while Apple consists of 12.2% of the fund’s total assets. More than a quarter of VUG’s total holdings are in those two stocks.VGT is even more lopsided toward those tech conglomerates. The fund has 20.5% of its total assets in Microsoft and puts 20.2% of its capital into Apple. Those two stocks make up more than 40% of VGT’s total holdings.VUG has the remaining members of the Magnificent Seven within its top 10 holdings. However, VGT deviates from this trend. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the only other Magnificent Seven stock within the fund’s top 10 holdings, as you can see below.While the five-year returns imply VGT is the better pick, this is a classic case of past results not guaranteeing future success. Although VGT has a big lead for that time horizon, VUG has outperformed it over the past six months. VUG is also the year-to-date winner, with a 10.5% return compared to VGT’s 8.6% return.I believe this trend will continue for a few reasons. The first reason is Apple stock. Although shares are up by 320% over the past five years, they are only up by 14.4% over the past year. Apple stock is actually down by 4% over the past six months.More than 20% of VGT’s portfolio is down by 4% over the past six months. That distinction only applies to roughly 12% of VUG’s total portfolio. Now, Apple can turn things around if the Vision Pro becomes the next big product, and I believe that product has the potential to deliver great returns. However, the rest of the company’s growth slowed down significantly and offers very limited upside other than the Vision Pro.Another big reason VUG looks more enticing is the portfolio composition. With Apple’s growth slowing, investors have to pay more attention to the other stocks in these funds’ portfolios. While both funds have Nvidia as their third largest holding, the funds deviate from there.VUG takes the expected approach of loading up on the Magnificent Seven stocks. That’s proven to be a good long-term decision, and those corporations have plenty of runway, excluding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for now.I also have an issue with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) being VGT’s 9th largest holding. That stock makes up 1.56% of the fund’s total assets but hasn’t budged by much over the years.Cisco stock is down by 6% over the past five years. While its dividend puts the investment in the positive, that’s not the pick you want to see in a growth fund’s portfolio. VGT has better five-year returns, but I believe VUG is poised to perform better over the next five years.VUG is rated as a Strong Buy based on 172 Buys, 35 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average VUG stock price target of $378.47 implies 12.5% upside potential.Meanwhile, VGT is rated as a Moderate Buy, with 231 Buys, 76 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VGT stock price target of $575.87 implies 11.5% upside potential. Nonetheless, analysts’ ratings suggest VUG will continue to extend its recent lead.Comparing stock charts doesn’t always yield the correct answer of which fund is the better pick. That seems to be the case with these funds. VGT has the better five-year returns but was more reliant on Apple’s ascent. VUG still has significant exposure to Apple but is better prepared for a slowdown in that stock.If Apple’s Vision Pro turns the stock into a winner again, VGT will outperform VUG, but that’s not guaranteed to happen. Both of these funds are heavily dependent on Microsoft and Apple, but it looks like VUG has better top 10 holdings than VGT.Disclosure",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/vug-vs-vgt-tech-heavy-194624798.html,AAPL,0.152,0.02,0.828,0.9991,Positive,169.92999267578125,168.94900512695312,-0.577289231513006,-1

2024-03-06 19:10:00,"Federal appeals court throws out lawsuit against Apple, Google, Tesla and other tech giants over alleged child labor in Congo","A federal appeals court on Tuesday threw out a lawsuit that sought to hold Apple, Google, Tesla and other major tech companies liable for their alleged use of child labor to mine cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The DC Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous ruling that while the plaintiffs who brought the suit in 2019 had the legal right — known as standing — to bring the case, they had failed to satisfy the legal elements necessary to pursue their claims against the companies.“Purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt through the global supply chain is not ‘participation in a venture’ within the meaning of’ federal anti-trafficking law,” Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote in the court’s ruling.“The plaintiffs have not adequately alleged the Tech Companies participated in a venture because there is no shared enterprise between the Companies and the suppliers who facilitate forced labor,” Rao wrote. “The Tech Companies own no interest in their suppliers. Nor do the Tech Companies share in the suppliers’ profits and risks.”But, Rao noted, “the cobalt suppliers and their subsidiaries actively solicit and force children to work in order to meet the Tech Companies’ growing demand for cobalt.”Cobalt is a major component of lithium-ion batteries found in virtually every rechargeable electronic gadget. Two-thirds of the world’s cobalt comes from Congo.A federal judge in DC had previously thrown the case out. But the group of plaintiffs, which includes former underage miners who were injured in cobalt mining accidents and the guardians of children who were killed while working in cobalt mines, turned to the appeals court in 2021 to revive their suit.The defendants in the case were Apple, Alphabet (which owns Google), Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla.The class action lawsuit was brought on behalf of the plaintiffs by International Rights Advocates, which had claimed that the children were exploited and hurt in mining operations linked to the mining companies Glencore, Umicore and Huayou Cobalt, which the group said supply to either some or all of the defendants. None of those companies were listed as defendants.Michelle Toh contributed to this report.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/federal-appeals-court-throws-lawsuit-191009871.html,AAPL,0.043,0.087,0.8690000000000001,-0.9638,Negative,170.09500122070312,169.1699981689453,-0.5438155413853665,-1
2024-03-06 18:27:00,"UPDATE 3-US court sides with Apple, Tesla, other tech companies over child labor in Africa","(Adds editing attribution)By Jonathan StempelMarch 5 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to hold five major technology companies liable over their alleged support for the use of child labor in cobalt mining operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet , Apple, Dell Technologies, Microsoft and Tesla, rejecting an appeal by former child miners and their representatives.The plaintiffs accused the five companies of joining suppliers in a ""forced labor"" venture by purchasing cobalt, which is used to make lithium-ion batteries that are widely used in electronics. Nearly two-thirds of the world's cobalt comes from the DRC.According to the complaint, the companies ""deliberately obscured"" their dependence on child labor, including many children pressured into work by hunger and extreme poverty, to ensure their growing need for the metal would be met.The 16 plaintiffs included representatives of five children who were killed in cobalt mining operations.But the appeals court said buying cobalt in the global supply chain did not amount to ""participation in a venture"" under a federal law protecting children and other victims of human trafficking and forced labor.Circuit Judge Neomi Rao said the plaintiffs had legal standing to seek damages, but did not show the five companies had anything more than a buyer-seller relationship with suppliers, or had power to stop the use of child labor.She added that many other parties are responsible for labor trafficking, including labor brokers, other cobalt consumers and the DRC government.""Without more specific allegations, the question is whether the tech companies' purchasing an unspecified amount of cobalt from a supply chain originating in DRC mines plausibly demonstrates 'participation in a venture' with anyone engaged in forced labor in that supply chain,"" Rao wrote. ""We hold that it does not.""Terry Collingsworth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email said his clients may appeal further, and could file new lawsuits if the companies' conduct met the court's test.The decision provides ""a strong incentive to avoid any transparency with their suppliers, even as they promise the public they have 'zero tolerance' policies against child labor,"" he said. ""We are far from finished seeking accountability.""Google had no immediate comment. Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Tesla and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Tuesday's decision upheld a November 2021 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington.The cobalt suppliers included Eurasian Resources Group, Glencore, Umicore and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt , court papers show.

Models of the physical world that understand our world and are updated almost in real time. That's where it starts to get really interesting and a little scary, from a privacy perspective, I'll be honest.Mary Long: I'm Mary Long and that's Cathy Hackl, a futurist, author, and an Apple Vision Pro developer. Deidre Woollard caught up with Hackl for a conversation about spatial computing. They discuss how this technology could change meetings, manufacturing, and remodeling a kitchen, what the beginning of mobile can teach us about this computing revolution, and the difference between the technology and value in the Apple Vision Pro.Deidre Woollard: Let's talk about spatial computing. This is all about the Vision Pro. Apple wants us to believe this is the future of how we interact with technology. What's your take?Cathy Hackl: I want to start by saying that I think we need to take a step back, we're going to talk about the hype, of course, but not frame that conversation spatial computing around just one single device, and this is why. Because when you start to think about spatial computing, I think a lot of people are thinking of it in the context of only the Apple Vision Pro or some people might use it interchangeably with the word mixed reality. I am of a different mindset. I don't think that this is the same. Just like the internet is not the same thing as our mobile phone, I don't think special computing is the same as one single device or one single technology.What I mean by that is that spatial computing is an evolving form of computing that is 3D-centric and that uses technologies like AI, computer vision, mixed reality, and other technologies to blend virtual experiences in someone's experience of the physical world into a human's experience of the physical world. That being said, through spatial computing, we're also allowing technology, computers, robots, devices, hardware to start to navigate the physical world with us. It's a combination of a lot of new technologies and about human-to-human communication, but also human-to-computer interaction and it is not about one single thing.I would even go as far as saying this is a new field of technology and it is as revolutionary as mobile computing has been for all of us. Spatial computing I think people need to take a step back and realize what we're talking about here is the future of computing, the future of how we as humans will interact with technology in new ways, and not just one device or one single technology or even the metaverse and I know we're going to get into that.Deidre Woollard: I have to ask you, have you played with or used the Vision Pro and how does that relate to this overarching theory of spatial computing?Cathy Hackl: Definitely have used the device. I am personally an Apple Vision Pro developer, so I actually had a chance to try the device before many people did. I just couldn't speak about it publicly. Obviously, lots of NDAs and stuff, but now everything's out in the open. I had done things with it before. Obviously, when it came out to the public, I went and bought my personal unit and everything. I've definitely tried the device. I think the device is magical. I think a lot of people, when they first tried the device, they have this ""aha"" moment of awe of seeing technology in a new way in most of the people that I have noticed doing the reviews or doing their demos.I definitely have seen that throughout my career in technology when people try these new technologies. That being said, I think the device, and I've said this before, I think there is $3,500 worth of technology in the device. As of yet, I don't think there's $3,500 worth of value to the regular consumer. There is value there for developers like myself. Maybe for enterprises not yet, but because it's really early. It is a fantastic product. I think it is doing a lot of great things. It is extremely powerful, and another thing I think a lot of people don't realize is how much artificial intelligence is being used in this device. It's a version 1. It is the right product at the right time, to be honest, but it's not a mass-market product yet.Deidre Woollard: I love that you made that distinction between the value of it and the value to consumers. I'm curious, though, since you were a developer on this, how does developing for this vary with other experiences you've had before?Cathy Hackl: This one is a little bit different because, obviously, it's really new hardware that very few people had access to. Even the development process, you have to have a computer that has at least an M2 chip, so M3, M2. I think that in itself prices out maybe some developers from developing for this. If you want to develop using Unity, you have to have a Unity license. There's certain things I think right now that might make it hard for maybe a young kid in their dorm to develop for this. They could still develop using some of the native, let's say AR Kit or some of the native Apple part of the Apple ecosystem. But if you want to develop something really robust, you're going to need certain capabilities. So I would say that.I will say, though, because the device is so amazing and truly blends that physical world and virtual experience together, the possibilities of what we can develop are truly mind-blowing. As a developer, it is both an exciting challenge and an opportunity to start to create experiences that have never been created, that no one's really thought of, and that take full advantage of that value that is in the device, in the technology within the device. I think once we have more developers creating amazing content, we'll get to that point where there is going to be more value for the consumer, for the mass market. We're just not there yet with that part, but that's where the work of someone like myself, it's facial dynamics, comes into play. We need to create this content, we need to push the limits of the hardware and the technology and truly create mind-bending experiences.Deidre Woollard: Fantastic. Well, I'm curious about that because thinking about when the iPhone came out and there was not a lot of development. You had a few cool things you could do, but it was really two years later that ecosystem developed. Do you see a similar timeline happening here?Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent. This is version 1 and I would say this is like the beginning of mobile. It's really early. First of all, there might be a lot of apps available for the Vision Pro. That doesn't mean that discovering them is easy or that finding them is easy within the Vision Pro ecosystem when you're wearing the device, and that doesn't mean that all these apps are using the full capability of what the device can do in spatial computing. I want to be very clear about that. It is early. We're all testing and learning, even with the companies that I'm already working with, the early adopters. It's about exploring the potential of what this can become. It is about what are the early learnings that you can start to take when you're creating these new apps and new experiences.Because if you look at spatial computing from the perspective that it is the evolution of computing and that it is what comes after mobile computing and you start to think about it's not about just the device, but it's about every surface or the physical world around you becoming a spatial interface, then it starts to get interesting. Another thing I've noticed with the companies I'm working with is that they're also thinking long-term, and I tell them this. When you start to think about an iPhone 16, an iPhone 17, a Vision Pro 2, a Vision Pro 3 and other hardware that the ecosystem is going to throw at us, then it starts to get more interesting. Especially when you start to think about iPhones with more spatial capabilities, more spatial video, maybe some other things you might be able to do with the phone that you couldn't do before, that's where I think the companies and the mass market and more brands are going to be like, OK, so now maybe it's something we should pay attention to.That's when you start to not be only about 400,000 headsets being sold, but about millions or billions of people with these devices at hand that it starts to have these facial capabilities. A lot of us are playing the long game here. That long game is moving really fast, though. So I do have to say that. When people asked me, do I put it at 5-10 years? I can't tell you. I don't think anyone really can tell you. I would have to have a vision into every one of these companies' road maps to truly tell you is it five years from now, is it 10 years from now? I think we'll have to see and there's a lot of different parts that have to fall into place. This is the other part, which I think is interesting and people forget, is spatial computing has four components. It has the hardware, which obviously we as tech business people, we love overindexing on hardware, taking it apart, talking about all this stuff.There's the software. The software is where there's going to be a lot of work that needs to be done to create this content and create value and experiences. The connectivity. When you start to think about all these devices, if everyone's going to end up wearing glasses and all these devices connecting on edge and the types of connectivity we're going to need. Another level of not even 5G, we're going to need to take 6G and whatever comes next. Then there's also the part of the data, all the information that these devices need to operate because they're literally scanning the physical world almost in real time and then all the data they are going to produce. That obviously has a lot of implications. Long answer, but that's what I think right now.Deidre Woollard: [laughs] Well, as someone who invests in data center REITs, I'm like, ""OK, I see something happening here that I'm interested in."" I also want to talk about so many people focus with spatial computing on the consumer aspect like games and videos and things like that, but there are a lot of business applications here, too. I feel like people are ignoring a little bit of that part. But with spatial computing, thinking about for me from the real estate aspect, you have tremendous capability for business, digital twins, building information modeling. Talk to us a little bit about some of the business applications.Cathy Hackl: Yeah. I think that, obviously, a lot of people want to focus on consumer because that's a little bit more exciting to talk about, shopping and all that. But I think from the business perspective, there's already use cases that have astonishing results. I'll give you an example, Lockheed Martin, for example, used the Microsoft HoloLens, which is in essence a special computing device, and they achieved a 93% reduction in costs on the creation of one part of the manufacturing process for the Orion space vehicle. That's a 93% reduction in cost because they use spatial computing. So there's already a few use cases out there that show you that this technology can be extremely powerful. Spatial computing plus AI, you're starting to talk about revolutionizing a lot of different processes, whether it is manufacturing, whether it is real estate.With this technology, you can actually put the device on and show someone in the physical world what that is going to look like, what that building is going to look like, where the exits are going to be. You're going to be able to walk through a virtual building really, not in virtual reality, but in the physical world, seeing everything around you. That to me is extremely powerful. It's also going to allow you to tour a place that you might not be able to go. You can do that in virtual reality, and there's the Zillow app already in the Vision Pro.But right now it's more like 360 photos that you're walking around, so it's not that sense of presence just yet. But when we start to think about that, I think real estate from decorating your house, and Lowe's is already doing that in their Vision Pro with the kitchen. They have a kitchen demo where you can decorate your demo. But actually seeing what something could look like in the physical world I think is really exciting, or understanding from a construction perspective what the physics of the space could do to the design, the physical design of that house.I think there's a lot that's about to be impacted and because of the devices, but because the physical world becomes a spatial interface, the physical world becomes where we see technology. We no longer have to see it in these little rectangles that we carry around with us or on our computers, it starts to be all around us. So I think that that opens up opportunities for real estate, for finance, for education, manufacturing, of course, HR, you name it. Just like mobile computing has impacted most industries, I believe spatial computing as the evolution of computing, of future compute, will impact almost every industry.Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to talk a little bit about this co-presence idea because everybody wants a better meeting experience. When Meta first debuted some of the meeting experiences with the guys with the legs, everybody loved to make fun of that. But it seems like we are getting to a place where maybe we're getting closer to that. I was looking at what [Alphabet's] Google is doing with Project Starline, it feels like we're getting closer to actually making these remote meetings feel a little more like we're really together.Cathy Hackl: I will tell you, I had a demo of Project Starline last year at the Code Conference, and I was blown away. You're sitting in front of someone, you're not wearing a device. It's done through AI and cameras and you're seeing someone through a screen, but the screen is showing you a version of them in 3D, and I was so impressed by the fidelity. I could see someone's pores more than I would normally see them in person. I was like, ""Wow, this is crazy."" Or I remember the person I was doing the demo with had an apple and I literally just wanted to grab the apple from them because they moved the apple forward like they were giving me the apple, of course, I couldn't grab it, but those sorts of things. Something that really stuck with me in the presence part was the pores, but also I was wearing this ring, and you could see the detail on the ring. He could see the detail on the ring in such a way that was even better than eyesight. I don't know how to explain it.Deidre Woollard: Wow.Cathy Hackl: The detail was so clear that he said, OK, this could be really powerful, from a presence perspective. Right now, for example, with the Vision Pro, you can use your personas, which is like a 3D representation of you. It's starting to get a little better. The first couple of weeks very uncanny. It's still very uncanny, but it's starting to get a little bit better. I think they're starting to improve that. I think we'll start to get a little bit more high fidelity, let's say, of how we look in these devices. But the idea of presence, I think that's where it starts to get interesting. That's where it starts to also become something of value and of interest to the mass market because one of the most powerful things I've been able to do on my device is look at the video I took during the holidays with my parents. My dad is turning 80 this year. He's getting older. He's very healthy.But I was like, I'm just going to shoot as much as I can on my iPhone so I can have these facial videos of him reading Llama Llama Red Pajama to my kids, stuff like that that's special. When I put the device on and I can see these experiences in 3D, in spatial video, it's powerful. It's powerful and I'm like, is this the future of the family photo? Is this the future of how we might retain some of those memories? So that's where that idea of presence in real time but presence also after the fact I think could be very powerful and could become one of the reasons that someone like my dad might eventually, in a couple of years, get one of these devices. Just like back in the early mobile days, my dad wasn't on Facebook, [laughs] but he got on Facebook because that's where he could see pictures of his grandbabies. I think it's almost similar right now. But that idea of presence, I think, is going to be huge for human communications, both in the personal side but also the business side.Deidre Woollard: Well, you had mentioned AI earlier and I'm curious about how much you think, as spatial computing evolves, how much of it is going to be about co-presence, looking at memories, person-to-person communication versus person-to-AI communication and collaboration? Does this get us deeper into that? Because I feel like we went through the last year of generative AI, and Copilot, things like that. People are getting more integrated with AI. It seems like spatial computing takes that to a whole another level.Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent in the sense that anyone that's working with a ChatGPT, or a Copilot, or Claude, or whatever it is that you're using from that perspective, we're all engaging with it on our phones or our computers. That's where you're engaging with AI. So when you start to look at all these AI companies, they're all looking for that container, what they call a container, of where they're going to put their AI technology, and that comes in the form of hardware. Whether it is the R1 Rabbit that took over CES, whether it's the Humane AI Pin that a lot of people are curious about, whether it's the Vision Pro or whatever OpenAI and Jony Ive decided to create and bring into the world, it's all containers for how we engage with AI. I think that that's where this interesting conversation starts to happen, it's about engaging with technology in new ways.The other part here that is an important part of the conversation, I think a lot of people are not having this conversation or understanding it, is that right now a lot of the generative AI that we're talking about is large language models trained on language. Even when you look at something like Sora or Runway, it's trained on video, but it's video of things that have already happened or photos of things that have already been created or happened. Once you start to have these devices that are scanning the physical world in real time, you start to create what I call large vision models, models of the physical world that understand our world and are updated almost in real time.That's where it starts to get really interesting and a little scary, from a privacy perspective, I'll be honest. But I see the evolution of what comes after large language models as large vision models. Models that truly start to become world builders, that truly have understanding of the physical world. We're not there yet. I don't want people to get too excited, it's the beginning of it. But these devices are going to start to create these models of the world. They're going to start to understand our world so that we can engage with AI in totally new ways, in ways that are going to feel seamless. There is I think this evolution. I think a lot of people are not understanding what these devices can do when they're reading the physical world around us.Deidre Woollard: I think that's really fascinating because it makes me think of the difference that happened when we had mobile devices and all of a sudden you could see where everybody was, but you're just seeing that point, you're seeing a dot. Now you're seeing all of this information, and the computers are all processing and layering all that information. There seems like so many applications for that.Cathy Hackl: We're accessing that data layer. The data layer is, we can't see it as humans, but there's all this data around us. But once you have these devices that we can use to see through, glasses hopefully, like very nice glasses in the future, and they're reading the data that we can't really see, you start to access this new data layer. That's when I talk about virtual experiences in someone's experience of the physical world. That's where it starts to get interesting. You start to see all this data, not on your phone and a little pin, but actually in front of you in the way of an annotation, a hologram, or whatever it is that you're going to be accessing. Yeah, it starts to get really interesting really fast, and that's where compute power, processing power, where connectivity at levels we've never seen where edge, cloud, that's where it starts to get interesting when talking about spatial computing in the perspective of AI chips or cloud computing, all these sorts of things that need to be in place for us to be able to truly access that data layer in the physical world.Deidre Woollard: Interesting. It is. I'm just going so many places. You mentioned that you have children, I'm assuming youngish children, and I feel like for young people, their experience of the physical self and the virtual self is much different than for me growing up because they're growing up playing in Fortnite, in Roblox, and they're dressing their avatars, they're thinking about that. As we look to a spatial computing future, it seems like there's a a consciousness that exists in two places. Do you see that kind of thing happening?Cathy Hackl: A hundred percent. My three kids are all Generation Alpha, and I've been doing a lot of research and work on Generation Alpha. The kids of Millennials being born in 2010 and still being born. So Gen Alpha is in the process of growing up, let's say. I always say this, to them, what happens in the virtual space is equally real. My kids don't make a differentiation between the real world and the virtual world. It's just different parts of the world. It's a spectrum to them. I always say this, if they fight with a friend in Fortnite and they see them at school the next day, they're still going to be mad. [laughs] It doesn't change because it happened in Fortnite.It's still an interpersonal relationship. So these spaces are social spaces. They fluctuate between them, it doesn't make a difference for them. They just flow between them. It's very natural for them. Yeah, that is a difference I think for other mindsets, Millennials and up probably. It's harder for us to wrap our head around, but I see it with them day in and day out. That's when you start to think about special computing and gaming or even fashion. It unlocks a new world of self-expression, it unlocks new opportunities for them to socialize in new ways. For this younger generation, Gen Z and Gen Alpha mostly, because Gen Alpha is really who's grown up with this being ubiquitous, it's truly changing the way they interact.Deidre Woollard: Well, I think the fashion question is interesting because I know you've invested in some virtual fashion. Now it's like Fortnite skins and things like that. But it seems like it could go in whole new places and really be valuable to people.Cathy Hackl: Yeah, I think it's about to unlock a new era for fashion and luxury and retail, in the sense that when you start to have a way for you to see fashion in new ways, where I'm going to be able to walk around and if you're wearing your glasses, you're going to be able to see the outfit I want you to see on me, or I might be able to change my outfit depending on if I'm going into this store right now or this office for this meeting. Maybe I'm meeting my friends for coffee, but then I'm going to have a job interview. Virtually, I might be able to change the way I look.I think that there's going to be some interesting things there. You already have, for example, London Fashion Week, a partnership they have with a company called SYKY, who, I'm a big fan of and I'm a holder of their NFT, and we can talk about NFTs for sure. But I'm a member of their community. I think they're starting to unlock fashion in a mixed-reality sense where there's a phygital, I don't like that word too much, but there's a physical expression of fashion and there's a virtual expression of fashion, and those expressions are starting to collide and get closer together.Definitely a lot of the conversations I'm having are with fashion brands that most of them are at the forefront of pushing these technologies. They've experimented with augmented reality in the AR try-ons for a long time and now they're like, ""What comes next? What does this mean?"" If this is already proving to be a way for us to create sales and create engagement with our community, what does this mean when you start to unlock this? Yeah, I think we're about to see fashion and technology coming closer together than they have ever been.Deidre Woollard: Let's talk a little bit about NFTs as we wrap up because we had the NFT hype, we had the metaverse hype. Now I'm hearing maybe metaverse real estate suddenly is becoming valuable again. So you've been an integral part of all of these movements, now you're looking back on what came before and what is happening now. It feels to me like there's a way that what happened before sets up what happens now. But what are you seeing?Cathy Hackl: There was definitely obviously a lot of hype over a lot of these NFTs, speculative assets. Let's be honest, they were speculative assets. I mean, I got into a lot of these as a speculative asset. I'm not in most of them anymore, to be honest. I've divested myself from that. But I do think it did prime the market and the business world to understand that you can still own virtual things. That there is something that you could own virtually, it's in the code. I think it did change the mindset a little bit in that sense. It was overhyped and everything. When it comes to real estate, I don't know if I would go back and invest in some of the virtual real estate.I don't know if I would personally do that again. It looks interesting. It would have to be a really good value proposition for me to get back in there. We'll have to see. Where I think it starts to get really interesting in that perspective is virtual air rights, and stay with me here for a second. When everything you can see and everything you can hear becomes real estate, then that's where you start to figure out, OK, well, should people be able to own this?Should a company be able to own this? What I see and what I can hear, can they own the space around me? Can they own the space on top of my house? Can they own where I live in the virtual space? So I think that that's where you start to get really interesting conversations as far as who owns the virtual layer that is on top of the physical world that you're able to see through spatial computing. A lot of the conversations around virtual real estate that were had I think are going to be very valid when you start to think about virtual air rights. I can't remember which country it is right now.There's a country in the Caribbean that already has certain laws related to virtual air rights. You own the virtual air on top of your house up until a certain height. I think we're going to start to have these really, it keeps me up at night, doesn't keep most people up, it keeps me up at night because I really start to think about this becomes real estate. It's not just a floating billboard in Times Square that you're seeing, it starts to become everything around you. As I said, exciting for some things, a little nerve-wracking in other senses. So I think some of the conversations around virtual ownership start to become really relevant, and the role of blockchain when it comes to what you might be seeing and if it's real, if it's an authorized thing, it starts to seep into this conversation of the future spatial computing.Deidre Woollard: Wow. Well, thank you so much for your time today. This is so fascinating. Where can people keep up with you because you're going to a million places?Cathy Hackl: I am.

2024-03-06 18:05:00,"Apple’s iPhone sales plummet 24% in China, while Huawei’s skyrocket 64% as Chinese consumers abandon American tech","In China, consumers are opting to buy domestic products amid increasing tensions with the West, at least when it comes to their smartphones.Apple’s iPhone sales in the world's second largest economy, which are critical to its global revenues, nosedived 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a new report from Counterpoint Research. But over that same period, China’s tech giant Huawei saw its sales surge 64%. Apple has struggled against “stiff competition” for high-end products from the “resurgent” Chinese competitor, Counterpoint’s senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang said of the data in a statement.Since last summer, Huawei has benefitted from the release of its Mate 60 phone series after struggling to source parts for many months due to Western sanctions. The new phone features 47% Chinese-made parts, 18 percentage points higher than the previous model, and is even powered by a Chinese-manufactured chip. The Mate 60 amounts to a major upgrade for many Huawei users, but Apple’s iPhone 15 isn’t quite as enticing among its user base, according to Counterpoint’s Zhang.“Although the iPhone 15 is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,” she said.Increasing competition in the Chinese smartphone market is a big concern for Apple, given the company’s China iPhones sales hit $20.8 billion last year, a sizable chunk of their total phone sales of $69.7 billion. Apple’s Chinese smartphone market share also dropped to 15.7%, from 19% a year ago, making it the fourth most sold phone in China, compared to second in 2023.Apple’s stock took a hit on the news of its sales struggles on Tuesday, sinking over 2.5% by midday. Shares of the big tech giant are now down over 8% year to date after surging 46% in 2023. Weaker-than-forecast iPhone demand, a lack of AI development compared to other Big Tech competitors, the decision to abandon a decade-long bet on EVs, and a $2 billion fine from the European Commission that brought antitrust threats front and center are the main reasons for the weakness.Even Wedbush’s tech analyst Dan Ives, a noted Apple bull, admitted that Wall Street’s fears about Apple’s prospects “resemble a horror show right now,” noting that Chinese smartphone demand is “very sluggish” at the moment.The veteran analyst remains bullish about Apple over the long term, however, due to “pent-up demand” for smartphone upgrades, which should lead to 270 million unit sales for the iPhone 16. Ives also believes Apple will begin to compete with its Big Tech rivals in the AI space after ditching its EV dreams.“Over the last decade we have been through many challenging periods in the Apple story and we handheld investors through these stormy periods just like today,” he wrote. “This is no different and in our view brighter days will be ahead for Apple although right now the China story remains the dark cloud over the name in the near-term.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/news/apple-iphone-sales-plummet-24-180529063.html,AAPL,0.06,0.075,0.865,-0.8148,Negative,170.2949981689453,170.10499572753906,-0.11157253204686225,0

2024-03-06 17:25:00,YTD Losers: 3 Tech Stock Laggards That Could Come Roaring Back,"Some stocks have been sitting on the sidelines amid this hot AI-driven market rally. Only time will tell when the market’s gains will broaden and help the year-to-date (YTD) losers; value-focused investors have a lot to love about the “left-behind” cohort. AI works its magic in more than just firms building AI models or GPUs powering them. In this piece, we’ll look at three mostly misunderstood tech stock laggards to buy,Far too many folks are quick to discount or dismiss AI plans entirely. Of course, nobody wants to play from behind when it comes to next-generation technologies, like generative AI. However, it’s much better to play late than not at all.Let’s check out three YTD tech losers I wouldn’t count out yet. Maybe, just maybe, one of them can be the tortoise that eventually overtakes the many hares in the tech scene!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock seems to be rolling down a steep hill at full speed, with shares plunging 7% on Monday’s flat-ish day for broader markets. Year to date, TSLA stock is down almost 25%. That’s a drastic decline in just north of two months. And while electric vehicles (EVs) are the hot tech trend of yesteryear, this sell-off could prove a buying opportunity for those with the pain tolerance to buy the dip.It’s hard to believe, but Tesla stock has shed around 54% of its peak value. As EV sales hit a speedbump, investors should keep their sights on the road ahead, not the rear-view mirror. The company is working hard on advancing its battery tech, self-driving capabilities and Tesla Dojo supercomputer.In the meantime, Dojo and its impressive AI talent alone make Tesla stock worth watching on the way down as other investors begin to view the firm as more of an auto play than an AI company.Source: Moab Republic / ShutterstockApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was under some serious pressure on Monday, shedding around 3% of its value at the worst part of the trading day before closing off by 2.5%. Year to date, AAPL stock is down around 6%, while the Nasdaq 100 is up more than 10%.Undoubtedly, Apple got slapped with a stiff fine — close to $2 billion — from the European Union (EU) due to its music-streaming dominance. These anti-trust penalties come amid increased fear that Apple may be behind in the generative AI race.My take?Don’t discount the words of Apple’s legendary CEO, Tim Cook. Investors shouldn’t discount its potential if he’s hinting at generative AI tech on the horizon. Additionally, Apple quietly launched new Macbook Airs with the latest and greatest Apple Silicon: the M3 chip. The company calls it “the world’s best consumer laptop for AI.”Overlook the Macbook Air launch, but I think it’s the start of many AI-driven things for the year.At around $175 per share, Apple stock goes for around 27.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), a pretty reasonable multiple to pay for one of the planet’s most cherished consumer products companies (and underrated AI innovators).Even if Apple’s playing from behind, it’s still very much in the game.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a software company with a less-than-ideal start to 2024, with shares down around 9% year to date. The company, which makes software products for developers, is innovating on the AI front to stay ahead in its corner of productivity software.Given the productivity-enhancing powers of generative AI, AI has become a must for Atlassian. Though AI could pave the way for rival firms, I’d argue Atlassian’s wide economic moat may not be so quick to narrow.From incorporating AI-generated summaries to offering a wide range of AI apps on its own marketplace, Atlassian has a world of upselling opportunities as it looks to showcase what AI has to offer at the workplace. The company aims to “accelerate work” with its suite of AI tools. And thus far, I’d say the firm’s done a great job of staying at the forefront of the AI revolution.On the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple.

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma. Asit, thanks for joining me today.Asit Sharma: Dylan, thank you for having me.Dylan Lewis: We've got a double-stack short squeeze and the inside scoop on the world of hedge funds. But we're going to kick off today talking about a long-awaited car that it appears will never arrive. Asit, after almost a decade of speculation, Apple is apparently abandoning its vehicle efforts. Word out this week that the tech giant will be shifting employees working on its auto ambitions, code-named Project Titan, over to other projects, including those focused on artificial intelligence.Asit Sharma: This comes as little surprise, maybe to some, just because Apple has been working for so many years on this effort, it hasn't been able to come to fruition. So perhaps this writing was there on the wall. But before we get into maybe some of the implications of the not-so-great part of doing this investments for so many years. I just want to say that Apple has so much in terms of engineering talent on hand, so much on its balance sheet, so much time to innovate that it can do Skunk Works projects like this, that for any other business would be existential and just pull off, and that's maybe not necessarily a bad thing.Dylan Lewis: This truly was a Skunk Works project. I'm glad you drop that word there because so much of our understanding of what this project was and even what Apple's ambitions were when it came to the cars, really came by way of following permits, following patents, following acquisitions the company had made and sources that reporters had that were willing to spill a little bit about what was going on. The company itself did not give very much on what was happening behind the scenes and what it was trying to do in automotive, which even in trying to process this information makes it a little hard. Because I think we'd wondered for a while, does the automotive ambitions here mean hardware in the conventional sense? Or is there something else at play, even knowing they're going to be diverting some resources away from that, we're still not really sure.Asit Sharma: I agree. I think most of us thought at the end of the day that Apple was trying to find the next great delivery vehicle, no pun intended, [laughs] or pun intended, for its software services. The car would be a place where you would have access to all of Apple's great software. So in terms of what this was, well, it was R&D, research and development. So much of the time we think of research and development is being innovation or improving products. But it's also tinkering. It's trying to figure out what could be the next thing that gives us access to this wide, wide path of revenue. For Apple, there were some limitations here in that they were trying to develop something in an industry which itself was undergoing so much change. We still don't know today from a consumer perspective, if we want to drive EVs. From an industry perspective, if it should be conventional vehicles, EVs, or hybrid vehicles, are we going autonomous or not? Apple was trying to build a car during a time in which no one really understands what the future is going to be like out on the road and this made it doubly hard. Throw in the idea of maybe having an AI-enriched product that would be superior to anyone else's software where you have Tesla, which has been building a supercomputer and grabbing data from its cars on the roads for many, many years. Trying to compete with this type of technology itself is just another Skunk Works project, I think at the end of the day, Apple called a really good play, which is to exit and say, look, we've got some learning here. We can transfer this to other parts of the business. But this is the best place for us to capitalize on our strengths and because they're so big and so successful, really not going to hurt them. At the end of the day, they'll shuffle some good people around and move on to the next great idea.Dylan Lewis: I think I follow you on that take there, Asit. I wouldn't be terribly surprised if some of the work, some of the investment, the research and development that went into this project winds up showing up somewhere at some point, just maybe not in the way that we would have expected. I was always a little skeptical that it was going to be cars as hardware and felt like we were going to see something more in the software lane. It's not out of the realm of possibility that some of the work that was done here winds up showing up in cars at some point, just maybe in a way we haven't quite thought of before.Asit Sharma: I agree, and in the requests to other parts of the company, when you're in a unit like this, which is out there on your own developing a technology. There is a lot of intellectual reach that goes on. So you request of the chip team, could we design a chip that would do X? You requested the AI team, if I had to train this neural network to take a left turn suddenly here, how would we do this? Not having that technology in-house. So all of these requests that the unit would give to other parts of the company can be expanded upon and put to other uses. So I don't think all of this is wasted effort. Did they lose a lot of time? Sure, Dylan. I can remember, you probably don't, like seven or eight years ago when I was a writer for Motley Fool and you were an editor, you asked me to do a small report on the then-Project Titan, I don't even know if it was called that again. This is how old it is, two or three positions ago, almost a decade ago, I remember you asked me about this. So yeah, it's something that only a few companies around can afford to spend more than 10 years on. But I do think that's still before I move on to the next topic, maybe comes back to that ever-present existential question for Apple, what next after the iPhone and it's not going to be cars, clearly.Dylan Lewis: We're still waiting for Apple's next chapter, it turns out. From cutting-edge tech over to cutting-edge food, shares of Beyond Meat, the plant-based protein maker up huge today and it followed earnings, Asit. But if you look at the earnings results on the surface, not all that impressive. Sales down 8%, company continued to log huge losses. But I think as we tape, shares up 40% and that is due in large part it seems, to the shorts out there that have interest in this company.Asit Sharma: Certainly, Dylan. When I looked this morning, I was surprised to see how high that short interest is, it's something like 38% of shares outstanding are now sold short and it's going to take several days to cover those shares. I think the days to cover is something like eight days. So that shows that there is a phenomenal amount of short pressure there. And perhaps any small good news would cause a reaction like this. The interesting thing, looking at the trail of this short interest is people being negative on Beyond Meat for a while. I went to a free site that shows data for a couple of years and for the last two years, on any given day, the short interest has been 40%-plus. It looks like some short-sellers have ridden this successfully down all the way from, I think like $26 a share down to the previous day's close, let's let's put it that way. So it's been a decent trade if you're a short-seller for a long time and maybe some people got lulled into thinking this just keeps going on until the stock goes to zero.Dylan Lewis: Yeah. I look at Beyond and I say this is clearly a company that has struggled. I think their losses were twice their top line or their operating losses were about twice their top line. So this was a business that was having a very hard time finding its footing, finding the correct pricing for consumers out in the marketplace. I think in reality, I probably agree with a lot of the points that would be in a short thesis for this company. That said, you mentioned, it doesn't take much for a company like this to turn things around or to rise a bit when there's such high short interest in the earnings report that we saw from this business, management said we're expecting gross margins in the mid-teens for 2024. Right now, gross margin's negative 20% in 2023. So that was the news that sent this company flying. I look at short interest in general and when you see mounting bets against the business like this, I have to say over the last couple of years, we have seen this go the wrong way in very high-profile ways for so many investors. I continue to be amazed that investors can be so greedy piling into something that's so heavily shorted.Asit Sharma: I totally agree. The people who are short as of yesterday, I think they're in two camps. One, they know exactly what they're doing. No. 2, they don't know anything about what's they're doing. [laughs] So the first camp is taking a risk. The shares are now down to $6, that this is going to zero. They have an idea that Beyond Meat made a fundamental misreading of the market and the shelf space that they could acquire globally, and that's been their problem. You cite the negative margins and they believe that there's no way this can be turned around. The other camp is following the herd getting in because the narrative's so bad. But just looking at your point here, Dylan, the balance sheet, while it's not great, has shown some improvement in one important area over the last year, inventory has gone down from $236 million to $130 million. When you combine that with what is going on in the statement of cash flows, a cash burn that went from $320 million in operating cash to a burn of $108 million in 2023 year over year. There are some signs there that maybe if gross margin went positive and costs were cut drastically, this company could stick around for a few years. So why do we have short interest still at 38%? It comes back to, I think a key word you just uttered, greedy. There's some greed going on here that's getting punished today.Dylan Lewis: Yeah, and for what it's worth, there are some other big names out there with pretty high short interest getting above that 30% range. You look out there, Novavax, Trupanion, Upstart, Carvana, C3.ai, Lemonade, Plug Power. I'm not making a judgment on whether those are quality businesses, but I do think if you're seeing it creep up like that, that is a sign that it won't take very much for you to go upside down on your short bet.Asit Sharma: I agree. So if you're going to be part of that 30% plus, I beg you, people, read the narrative but also look at the numbers. Just make sure that an unexpected piece of good news doesn't cause you to raise to cover and maybe face a window of eight days to get there.Dylan Lewis: All right, Asit. That story with Beyond was earnings adjacent. We're going to wrap our news rundown with a true focus on company results. Coupang, the leading South Korean e-commerce company, reported this week, shares up 5% after the company posted its best sales growth since 2021. What's driving the company forward?Asit Sharma: Dylan, the company is really benefiting from the investments that it made in its pre-IPO phase when they were fueled by crazy money by a number of investors, so they were able to invest billions into infrastructure in South Korea, which we've talked about on this show, has a really interesting topography. The geography of South Korea is very interesting, so it's really hard to build a logistics business. They went there, they raised some public money, built out a logistics and fulfillment arm, and now between their delivery service, services like Coupang Eats food delivery, and a service which lets small merchants operate like third-party sellers on their platform, much in the way that the Amazons and Shopifys of the world do here in North America, they were really starting to get some traction. Net revenues were up 23% year over year to $6.5 billion in the last three months, and the company made a profit of a billion bucks on that. So we're starting to see some traction in this model. It's not quite optimized yet, and I do think that growth might be lumpy and hit some challenges, but at least the narrative that Bom Kim, who is a really great entrepreneur, brought to the market is starting to play out. Plus, they're expanding into Taiwan, which gives some of the bears on Coupang, some food for thought. This was always seen as a one-shot play in the e-commerce market of South Korea. Coupang's actually retraced a bit from some other geographies has tried to expand into, but it is starting to see a little bit of success in Taiwan, which itself has a great market, so maybe there's a silver lining there for revenue. I really like these numbers, I think that the company has mastered this hard logistics delivery equation in South Korea. They do it profitably and they are investing in some other areas of the business, those are losing money right now. It's just some small bets on things like fintech, but they represent growth areas. Last I wanted to say just in summary here I like that the total active customer count is still rising. It was up in the mid-teens, again, trying to saturate that South Korean market where they've sort of eclipsed competitors. Now, it's their mission to get as much of that market as they can. You do that by growing customers and making sure they're spending a little bit more, which the average spends per active customer is also up about 6%. So just a well-rounded report, and I think the stock is performing accordingly today and probably should be a decent, interesting company for people to research in the coming years, those who are looking for a retail story.Dylan Lewis: Asit, you mentioned the international expansion for them and looking to get into other markets. One of the other ways this company has been looking to grow is through its acquisition of Farfetch, which is more on the luxury side of apparel and retail. They spent around $500 million for that acquisition, and I think at the time it was kind of controversial in terms of its strategic fit and its use of capital. I'm curious, do you feel like we're in a position where we can grade that yet or are we still waiting to really see how that shows up?Asit Sharma: Yeah. I think we are OK to wait. Actually, Bom Kim, the CEO said, look, we just bought Farfetch. We did this because it has $4 billion dollars in gross merchandise volume passing through its platform every year, and that's really what we're after. But he also said it's really too early to talk about it. We think it's going to be a great decision, but we're still looking on how to capitalize this, and I think investors can spot Coupang some time here because their strength is distribution, they've proven that. This was one of the problems with Farfetch. While it really brought a lot of small luxury players together in the market, it could never solve the problem of how to give them the tools for them to sell to a wide audience, and then make money at the same time from the take on the platform, the fees that were charged. Coupang is really good at this, that's a strength of theirs. They just haven't done it in high-fashion mode, like a luxury type of distribution model. So I think letting them tinker around and figure this out is fine, as long as the rest of the business is really firing away as we just walked through and generating a lot of free cash flow, a lot of profits. I'm willing to wait a few quarters to see what they can do with Farfetch.Dylan Lewis: All right. Asit Sharma, thanks for joining me today.Asit Sharma: Thanks so much, Dylan. I had a lot of fun.Dylan Lewis: Coming up. Hedge funds control over $5 trillion dollars in assets. What's it like to work for one? Up next, Deidre Woollard talks to Carrie Sun, author of the new memoir, Private Equity, for a look into the power, pain, and privilege in the world of hedge funds. Just a programming note, some of the answers have been trimmed for length and clarity. Enjoy.Deidre Woollard: Well, there's such a mystique around the world that these funds, but in the beginning of the book, you point out that while the average stock hedge fund beat the S&P total return by over 5% in the years 1990-2009, it's been a different story since then. BDS talked about that a lot, but there's still so much money, billions of dollars flowing to these funds. So what is some of the allure of that world?Carrie Sun: I just think the thrill of the possibility of extremely high returns to outperform the market is just so not only is it so American, but I think it gives people so much hope for the future, and I think that possibility itself of just beating the market is just so alluring to many people. As you mentioned, in the last decade and certainly during the 2010s, bull market hedge funds have broadly underperformed routinely. I think that thrill of possibly picking a winning hedge fund and sticking with them through years and compounding those returns is just so exciting for a lot of people. I think also by investing in hedge funds, I think people are investing in a certain type of exclusive access. By that I mean, so if you're investing in hedge funds as an asset class, you are investing in their ability to get themselves in front of company management, CEOs, CFOs, fighting for these corporate meetings that provide more information than say, in financial statements. So you're getting access to the ultimate companies you're investing in. But also many of these funds have investor days, LP conferences, and just to be on the inside to be an LP. Some of these very exclusive high-performing hedge funds that itself is such an elite exclusive clubs such that if you're at an investor day at one of these top exclusive hedge funds, you can meet not only people who hold and invest your money, but you can meet other LPs and just get a lot of connections and access that way. So I think for hedge funds itself, there's the promise of extremely high returns which still happens today. Even though historically, recently, they have been lagging the market. But just also to be a part of this very exciting, secretive club.Deidre Woollard: It's interesting in the book 'cause you go from the analyst side at Fidelity and then you take a break and you go into private equity, so to adjacent, but it seems very separate world. So what really surprised you about that shift?Carrie Sun: It was totally different, and when I was working on the analyst side, I wasn't investment side working in quantitative equities at Fidelity Investments. So and then I worked in the private equity, private funds, hedge fund side for my billionaire boss who is the founder of this large firm. I was more in a support role, but I also definitely did a lot of research for him, and I provided both administrative but also operational and research leverage to him. I think what surprised me was less so much going from the investment side to a support role, but rather just the whole industry going from quantitative investing to more fundamentally driven investing. The difference was just so stark. So at my former job, quantitative in nature, I just sat in front of my computer and I was coding all day. I was analyzing datasets, pulling datasets, cleaning them, trying to get them to work in order to build multifactor models from them for stock selection. It was sitting at my desk, analyzing data, doing a lot of coding, reading research papers, trying to find new factors that might work in quantitative and investing. I could go a week without talking to anybody except my boss for maybe 15 minutes, 30 minutes to just catch up on the work I did throughout the week. In the private equity side, I learned it was much more of a human and high-touch storytelling aspect to investing. That is to say that my phone rang every five minutes. I was also answering the phone on behalf of my boss. But also many people just called me to try to strategize how to get to my boss. So my phone was ringing all the time. I was talking to people all the time and yeah, I was having hundreds of little conversations every day and there's this line in my book about my boss saying he got 7,000 emails a day, and this is in the 2010s.On the quantitative side, my phone pretty much didn't ring. I was dealing with numbers, I was dealing less with people. So I think what that is also showing is that on the quantitative side, the decisions were mostly made. I would say what we were doing was more quantamental, which is a mix of quantitative and fundamental. But the decisions were made mostly by the computer, sometimes with human discretion to override some of those decisions. But ultimately, at the end of the day, there was no sense of urgency to a lot of the investment decisions that were being made. But then on the fundamental side, at the hedge fund, everything was urgent because news happens and then if news happens, you have to update your models for your investments. This was especially urgent during earnings season, for example. You were just always on the clock responding to news. So everything was urgent every minute of every day versus a more, at Fidelity, I really worked 9-5 sometimes six, five days a week. Of course, after that though, overnight, I was letting my models run and I was doing back-tests and simulations. But I really just sat on my desk and did coding for much of the day there. It was a lot more, the pace was just less everything is a fire and urgent and needed to be responded to instantly. So that was the biggest change from moving from one place to another.Deidre Woollard: The pace that you described in the book is certainly, it's brutal. It's hard because part of what you're talking about is access and information. You've got this great line in the book that I love about asymmetric knowledge being asymmetric power. So for the fund that you talk about in the book, so much of that is knowing things ahead of the news cycle. I'm wondering, even in the past decade since your experience, it seems like maybe there's a little more, everything becomes widely known. I don't know if you think that the value of that information has shifted to some extent.Carrie Sun: That's a great question because I think that yes, in general, I'm happy about the democratization of knowledge and financial knowledge and data itself. What I mean by that line, asymmetric knowledge is asymmetric power is, I think, certainly, these massive investment funds, they have ways of getting information and I'll say it's sometimes that can have a certain connotation, but I'll say there are interesting ways to get legal information before all other people. It's all about information, advantage, an edge. So like you say, even though I think the line has been moving about what information is easily obtainable versus more difficult to get, I think what many of these massive funds tried to do is it doesn't matter where the line is. They're going to try to just get right up to the line and get before it. So it really just doesn't matter, the line will and has been moving. But they will always try to be one step ahead of it. I think it's not even just purely in terms of information, but even in processes are ways to get information. I'll give you one tiny example and these examples I think accrue in just the ways you're able to get information. But when I started work at this fund that I write about in my book. So many people there, so I was born in China. I speak Mandarin and I got to the firm and so many people there spoke fluent Mandarin. Just from the looks, they were not of Chinese ancestry or descent. That might seem like a small thing. But if you're in these investor meetings and if you're in these if you're trying to do your due diligence on a company and meeting with management, being able to just have that rapport in a native language could be really helpful. They were, I think, really early to that, such that the people there were more fluent than I was and also reading Chinese.Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

2024-03-06 16:59:00,Apple Stock Gloom Deepens as Pressure to Show AI Progress Mounts,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s move to shutter its electric car efforts and divert those resources to artificial intelligence projects might have emboldened traders a year ago. Instead, the stock’s slump has only deepened.Most Read from BloombergOlivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly?

Investor impatience is growing, with the stock slumping 12% this year, pulling its market value below Microsoft Corp.’s.“Investors found this thing called generative AI that captured their attention last year and it’s taking money away from other tech companies because people want to be in the hottest thing,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners LLC. “Rightly or wrongly, Apple has to show that it’s still relevant in a world where investors want AI.”Read More: Apple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong OdysseyApple’s pivot comes as iPhone sales remain sluggish, with sales in China plunging during the first six weeks of this year. Its biggest new product release in years, the Vision Pro headset, is a long way off from contributing to sales growth in any meaningful way.“There’s been a real focus on how Apple hasn’t come out with some killer product in a very long time,” said David Klink, senior analyst of equity research at Huntington National Bank. “Obviously it’s been kind of a hard time for Apple holders to watch Nvidia and whatnot.”Wall Street is becoming more skeptical of the megacap giant. Apple was recently removed from Goldman Sachs’ conviction list and Evercore ISI’s tactical outperform list. The company has the lowest ratio of buy ratings to holds and sells since 2020.Read More: Apple’s iPhone Struggles in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge“Forget the car, what matters most for this stock is the AI strategy launch,” Melius Research analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote in a note dated March 4. “To us, it is the most important launch since the iPhone.”While Apple’s move away from EVs has been broadly welcomed, analysts are looking for the company to release its own generative AI product. Samsung Electronics Co.’s updated Galaxy line of smartphones can live-translate phone calls, transcribe voice recordings and use generative AI to fill in parts of photos.“Samsung has a generative AI phone right now and is getting a lot of positive buzz about it, and Apple doesn’t yet,” noted Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management. “Apple doesn’t have some of the current momentum drivers and so it’s lagging a bit, so I think it’ll be a second half story if some of these new products actually get out the door.”Still, for bulls, the company’s potential to capture public imagination with an AI enhancement means that investors should be patient. Melius analysts see new AI services driving users to upgrade their iPhones, kicking off a “supercycle” in 2025.“It’s time for a deep breath,” wrote Melius’s Reitzes, noting that 99% of Apple’s installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices “are never going to switch to Android — so a ‘comeback’ is likely.”And, long-time investors say that being a late mover is nothing new for Apple. Counting them out in the early innings of the AI cycle would be a mistake, according to Robert Conzo, CEO and managing director at The Wealth Alliance LLC.“Apple’s doing what Apple does best — it kind of waits, sits back and then sees how it’s going to position its products to take advantage of the AI craze,” he said.Tech Chart of the DayApple Inc. has erased more than $300 billion in market value since its shares closed at a record in December and has entered a technical correction for the first time since August.

2024-03-06 16:55:00,What the shakeup in Magnificent 7 stocks means for markets,"Stock market indices have been propped up on the success of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks up until late. As market gains begin to slow, is the aptly named tech stock group likely to become a set of laggards rather a catalyst?BTIG Managing Director and Chief Market Technician Jonathan Krinsky speaks on the bifurcation now evident, namely in Magnificent Seven components like Apple (AAPL).""The two longest streaks we saw were in 2006 and 2014.

We've now started to see that breakdown...""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.[AUDIO LOGO]- A rally in big tech has driven the market to record levels, pushing the S&P and the NASDAQ to recent all time highs. But it's not strength that we're seeing here across the board. Some cracks are starting to form in the Magnificent Seven trade. Invesco's QQQ, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 is up just over 8% since the start of the year. Now, compare that to the underperformance that we've seen in Apple stock, which is off here in negative territory since the start of the year.Here to tell us what that might signal ahead, we want to bring in Jonathan Krinsky. He is BTIG's Managing Director and Chief Market Technician. Jonathan, it's great to have you here. So what does this signal? Some sort of shakeout coming. And what do you think that could potentially look like?JONATHAN KRINSKY: Yeah. Thanks for having me. So if we take a step back and look at the big picture, obviously, it's been an amazing rally for the NASDAQ in general. We've now gone actually over 300 trading days, consecutive trading days without a down 2.5% day on the NASDAQ 100. That's the third longest streak since 1990.And so you could say that's a bit of complacency. You know, now, on the one hand, it is something you see in strong bull markets. The two longest streaks we saw were in 2006 and 2014. So when they ended, neither of them marked any sort of major top. But I think the point is that we're certainly overdue for maybe a bit of a shakeout.And then within the NASDAQ 100, we are starting to see some dispersion and bifurcation whereas last year was pretty much a uniform move higher for the Magnificent Seven. We've now started to see that break down. Obviously, Tesla has been the weakest link. But Apple, as you mentioned, down about 10% on the year. And recently, Alphabet or Google has started to roll over and break below its 200-day.So there's some dispersion going on. And then the last point we'd make is, what we noted yesterday to clients was a pretty rare setup in the sense that Apple-- the daily RSI was below 30 yesterday for Apple while the daily RSI for the NASDAQ 100 was above 65. We've actually never seen that since the inception of the QETF in 1999. The closest analog we have was back in late January 2018 when Apple's RSI got below 35 and the Q's RSI was still above 65.That saw Apple have about a 8% drawdown while the Q's-- QQQ was hitting new highs into the end of January. And then that led to that period known as Volmageddon in early February of 2018.- Yeah. I actually used to sit directly across from the office of Jonathan Jacobs, who came up with the NASDAQ 100, which led to the QQQs, of course. And is exactly what you're referencing there. It's really interesting here. One of the things that you put in your note, there have been lots of signals over the last few weeks that we haven't seen since either August 2020, tech will blow off or 2018's Volmageddon. What is the largest signal that investors should be paying close attention to right now?JONATHAN KRINSKY: Well, yeah. Again, I mean, you there's been things such as the volatility index has been rising a bit or holding firm with a rising market. That typically signals some sort of inflection point. Again, we mentioned the Apple signal. It's interesting. Breadth has actually been broadening. We've seen a new high for the Russell 2000. We've seen areas like materials and energy and even REITs start to actually act better. So on the one hand, breadth is broadening, which, I think, is encouraging.And that's something that investors have been waiting for a while, especially after last year was so dominant and not broad. So on the one hand, that is a good sign, on the other hand, if you look at some of the momentum indices or momentum strategies where it's simply buying stocks that have been going up, and generally, we are proponents of buying momentum.But when it gets to an extreme and buying just begets momentum and you get some of these very extreme readings we've been getting, that's when it gets a little bit concerning. Some of the AI semiconductor stocks certainly are exhibiting that. You could even look at some retailers like e.l.f. Beauty or Abercrombie that have just been kind of one way to the upside. So at some point, the rubber band does stretch too far. And I think we're kind of at that point for some of these names.- Jonathan, is this more indicative of more of a short term pullback rather than a top that could be forming over the longer term?JONATHAN KRINSKY: I think so. I mean, if you think about the fact that we just-- earlier this year or late last year broke above that 4,800 level for the S&P 500, that was 2 years in the making. So typically, if you go two years without any progress, you break out from it, you're not talking about a major top at that point.So maybe we do get a pullback and retest that 4,800 level on the S&P, which would probably be an attractive entry point. But yeah. I don't think we're talking about some sort of major top. Obviously, could be wrong there. But again, that broadening of breadth would argue against that. I think it's more just the near-term extended nature in some of the isolated pockets of the market.- Jonathan Krinsky-- BTIG Managing Director and Chief Market Technician.
